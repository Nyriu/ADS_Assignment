Ten Default Scenarios A-Train 8 will help realize your passion for railway management and city development with its ten default scenarios, intuitive gameplay, realistic 3D graphics, and in-depth map editor! Choose from one of our pre-constructed scenarios, each with a different element of challenge that will help you learn and ultimately master the game. Each scenario includes a city that needs you to solve a significant problem, such as uncompromising terrain, underdeveloped infrastructure, and poor management. Deep And Involved Gameplay As a simulation game, A-Train 8 is all about giving control to the players. Nearly everything you can think of can be managed, from train schedules to proposed projects to stocks. Once you make a decision, the results begin to take effect immediately. Constructing the right kind of buildings in the right area will lead to more commuters and further city development, a win-win situation. On the other hand, poor schedule management and overextending will lead to a loss in commuters, severely impacting your company’s bottom line. Every decision you make is important! Major factors that will affect your management include: Time & Weather: Time passes continuously in A-Train 8, affecting train and construction schedules. Weather will change constantly: both snow and rain are possible at a moment's notice! The Terrain: Certain areas are not ideal for development, and laying track over water is not cheap! Financial Information: You will have complete access to your company’s balance sheet, railroad statistics, city trends, and stock/real estate reports. These reports are constantly updated throughout the simulation. The Market: Equity and debt financing could very well give you the funds needed to expand your empire. You can buy/sell stocks, take out loans, and even sell real estate! Building Tracks: Every track your company lays must be planned carefully. Not only does track cost money, but inefficient or inadequate track will slow down city development and decrease the amount of commuters! Train Schedules: With the help of a Schedule Wizard and your own business sense, you will have the tools to create the most streamlined schedule possible given the circumstances. Smart scheduling will save your company money while still keeping the citizens happy. The Trains: Each train has a slew of advantages and disadvantages. Elements such as speed, cost, maintenance, and capacity must be taken into account. Realistic 3D Graphics To ensure the most realistic experience possible, A-Train 8’s graphics are inspired heavily by real trains and buildings. Trains: There are eleven trains available by default, ranging from commuters to freighters to lightning-fast magnetics. Buildings: Dozens of hotels, factories, high rises, and residential buildings are at your disposal. Build 60-story skyscrapers, parks, airports, and even amusement parks! Monuments: Place a unique stamp on your city with iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, and the Colosseum! Map Construction Mode Whether you’ve already mastered the default scenarios or you want to build your own area from scratch, A-Train 8’s Map Construction Mode will ensure that each simulation is unique. Once you’re happy with your custom map, you can simulate it in Game Mode and manage your company for real! Terrain Editor: In Map Construction Mode, you start with a large swath of flat land, ready to be molded into the terrain that you are envisioning. You have complete control over the map’s elevation and water, providing your map with uniqueness in both aesthetics and challenge. Lifted Limitations: Construction does not cost money or materials, allowing you to build a large city from scratch before you even simulate a single day! Customized Information: You can set the starting funds for your new simulation, opening up limitless possibilities for challenge. Imagine creating a minimalistic map with a large amount of initial funds, or a well developed town with a nearly bankrupted railway company that is struggling to keep it afloat.","$19.99"

An action game with tactical combat and citybuilding. An adventure game that lets you free-roam a vast, procedurally-generated world. A Valley Without Wind defies genre stereotypes. Unlike other procedurally-generated games, you also get a logical progression in difficulty, plus helpful tips and checklists to guide your travels (should you need them). Choose for yourself how to prepare to face the vastly stronger Overlord. Complete a variety of missions to earn new spells, and/or roam the wilds to uncover secret missions and stashes of magical crafting loot. Customize your characters with unique combinations of enchants and spells that change how you move, jump, and fight. Or rescue people and bring them back to your settlement so that they can then be sent on dispatch missions; you don't have to carry the burden of your fledgling civilization alone! You choose how to play, and the world adapts around you. Key features: Travel alone or with friends across an ever-expanding world of dangerous creatures, powerful magic, high technology, and mysteries. You have choice. The world of Environ is a procedurally generated sandbox, and lets you go anywhere you see -- including right into the overlord's keep at any time. (Good luck with that.) Environ is endless. When you save one continent from an overlord, a larger and more complex continent appears. The game adapts to how you play: as you demonstrate your proficiency, monsters and missions upgrade accordingly. Killed 100 bats? Okay, time for... bats on fire! Crazy amounts of character customization. Combine a multitude of spells, enchants, and equipment to create specialized character builds. Play as a long line of brave adventurers. It's not a question of IF your character is going to die, but WHEN. Any character that dies is permanently lost, but you keep all your inventory, enchants, and general progress in the game. Become a community leader. Rescue NPCs for your settlement, construct buildings for them, and improve their skill and mood -- then send them on dispatch missions to help you in return! Be a clever problem-solver. Challenges have more than one solution, each with its own pros and cons. You get to figure things out rather than just jumping through a set of hoops. Difficulty levels give exactly the challenge you want, from casual to hardcore on platforming, combat, and citybuilding independently. All owners of Valley 1 also get the much-improved sequel absolutely free!  Valley 2 is out now, and features a different style of more-focused, non-sandbox play.  Both games are quite distinct from one another, but you don’t have to choose between them -- both are yours for the price of one! ","$14.99"

You choose how and where to explore via the world map, how to upgrade your character via mage classes, feats, and perks that you unlock, and how to battle the forces of evil every step of the way. Your character is a mage who has infiltrated the inner circle of the evil Demonaica, and you now share the power of immortality that he uses to terrorize the land. Using this power against him, it's time to lead an uprising and ultimately bring him and his henchmen back to mortality so that they can be dispatched. Gameplay alternates between two modes that complement each other: brief, tightly-designed platforming segments where your character customization and equipment can be tuned to meet the tactical needs of the current stage; and quick strategic turns on the world map where you order your troops to fight, scavenge, build, recruit, farm, and use special powers.  Demonaica and his armies pursue your forces directly on the world map, while his five henchmen have been sent to recapture you in the platforming segments. Your immortality came at great personal cost, but it makes you the one last hope of saving the world from darkness. Key Features: Platforming and Turn-Based Strategy Coupled Together: Flip back and forth between your own adventure, and the progress of the resistance you're in charge of.  Freely adjust difficulty levels for both to tailor the experience to your own personal playstyle.  Both sides of the game can be quite easy or incredibly hard. More Tactile Combat: The physics of movement and attacks have been completely redone from the first title, with more traditional gamepad and keyboard support. Spells have mass and can block each other, leading to many interesting tactical situations in the platforming segments. Vastly Improved Visuals: Fully redone artwork by Heavy Cat Studios, including 125 all-new monsters, 200 spells, and lots more. Focused Gameplay Arc: Unlike the endless sandbox-style first game, this complete re-imagining has a distinct beginning, middle, and end. Procedurally Generated Worlds: Each world is a unique challenge, leading to excellent replay value once you do beat the game! Co-Op Multiplayer: Bring along as many friends as you like on your journey, depending on your connection speed. 2-8 players recommended on most Internet connections; many more on LAN. See Just How Deep An Arcen-style Rabbit-Hole Goes: After dozens of hours you still haven't seen it all: 50 mage classes in 5 tiers, 200 spells, 125 enemies, 14 biomes, 100+ types of world map tiles, 64 character customization perks, 100ks of procedural equipment possibilities. Extra Challenges For Expert Players: String together flawless kills to earn ""concentration"" and become even stronger.  Beat the game on harder difficulties to earn rare achievements.

Created by former Battlefield and Borderlands developer Richard Cowgill, Abducted is truly out of this world. Abducted is a game with focus on a complex storyline, immersive gameplay as well as a mixture of classic adventure game and RPG-lite mechanics.  It spans a wide range of gameplay types and environments, everything from a linear corridor type of experience to open world, non-linear gameplay.  You can expect plot twists, surprises, and an unconventionally told story with deeper, underlying meanings. Abducted draws its inspiration from classic adventure games and modernizes these ideas.  If you like any form of story driven adventure game Abducted is for you. Keep in mind, this is Early Access.  While the game is very far along in development and the whole game is there, several elements are not yet finished.  And bugs do exist, it is not yet ready to be stress tested. Gameplay & Mechanics The Arm One of the most interesting and mysterious things you will do is interact with an alien computer embedded in your arm, which we simply call “The Arm.” Why and how the computer got there is a critical element of the story. The Arm computer is your primary source of guidance and information. In truth, it’s your only friend and ally in an otherwise baffling and inhospitable world. You interact with your Arm computer by having conversations with it. We have developed a directed free-form conversation system that allows for near endless discussions. In Abducted the flow of conversation is player-driven and not predetermined. This is very different from games such as Mass Effect or Star Wars Knights Of the Old Republic where conversions are fixed in their structure. What does this mean for you as the player? It means that you can discover things through conversation in a very dynamic way. You may uncover information about your environment that gives you interesting backstory, unlocks a new ability or upgrade, or even saves your life. However, you are never forced to use The Arm. You can have deep hour long conversations with it or you can ignore it entirely. The Dreamscape The Dreamscape is the realm all around you, think of it as the world of metadata that you can't physically see.  But using your Dreamscape ability, you can leave your physical body and explore this realm free-form.  The aliens who made this place, whoever they were, left you all manner of clues and information to be discovered.  By exploring the Dreamscape you can solve puzzles, gain critical information and learn things you otherwise couldn't in human form. Manipulate In Abducted the environment can be “manipulated” (moved) by the player. Manipulating objects is a mysterious power that The Arm gives to the player. Some objects in the environment are deadly unless they are restrained from moving. Manipulate can be used to solve puzzles, defensively to create safe areas, or to otherwise save your life.  In some cases it can be used to open new paths and hidden locations. Pulse Your Arm can fire a bolt of energy that will obliterate anything in its path. It is a scary and often unwieldy weapon that if left charging too long has the potential to explode, killing you and anything unlucky enough to be in the vicinity. Pulse and your other abilities will gain upgrades during the course of the story that are narrative-driven.  These upgrades stay with you and open up new areas and possibilities. Shield The alien technology that inhabits your body can generate a close quarters force field that can protect you from incoming attacks.  In some cases the Shield will be the difference between life and death.  Like Pulse, as the story progresses new abilities will unlock allowing you to do things you otherwise didn't think were possible. Exploration In Abducted exploration is a mechanic in and of itself. The player has to combine critical thinking and his/her other abilities to successfully explore and travel through the environment without being injured or killed in the process. Sometimes exploration and progression involves run-and-gun intense action where you must use your Shield and Pulse abilities to blast your way through flesh-eating bugs as big as your head. Death in Abducted doesn’t just happen from being eaten. It can also come from all manner of environment hazards. Uncompromising Art We may be indie, but we don’t intend on looking like it. Sunside uses advanced 3D techniques that are typically employed in modern AAA games, but we do this more rapidly and with lower cost than big studios. One example of this is our main heroine of the story. Music and Sound FX Music and sound effects are extremely important to our environment. We have partnered with Voodoo Highway Music to produce all our music and sound for Abducted, and they have already created a large volume of amazing content for us. The result will be a game that is extremely immersive and environmental.","$14.99"

From indie Chilean developer ACE Team comes a new side-scrolling action adventure game featuring a complex fighting engine in procedurally generated levels that destines its three warriors to battle for an eternity.  Enter the bold Katrien, the tortured specter Ghost Monk, and the ethereal Pincoya.  Use the characters to perform combos, chaining attacks and releasing a flurry of blows in order to survive what lies beneath.  Your path into the unknown may start out with three fierce warriors, but when you learn to possess your enemies, you can challenge the abyss with their skills and combat abilities.  Each foe is as technically complex as the main warriors, so use all the options available to you and attempt to figure out the infinite abyss. With side-scrolling levels that never play out the same way twice, you'll have a fresh experience every game as you face monsters, find life-saving merchants, and uncover treasures. Begin your downward journey into the depths of the unknown. Key Features Deep combat system that takes cues and mechanics from the fighting game genre. All playable characters have an expansive set of basic and special attacks unique to each of them, along with a host of universal mobility options and advanced tecnhiques. Practice your moves and develop new combos in the Training room, where you can select any character you've unlocked in game, including the enemies. Procedurally generated levels ensure no delve into the Abyss is the same. The rooms of the Abyss with their various twists and traps are randomized on every entry. Enemy spawns, equipment and items to be found, special characters to encounter, and more are different each and every time you play. Unlock up to three hero characters to level up, earn skills, and collect equipment, then customize it all to best suit your play style. Leveling up earns skills points to upgrade each hero's unique skills a variety of ways, while various weapons and accessories can be equipped to grant them new abilities ranging from freezing opponents to cursing them. Play as any character you encounter in the game—even the bosses. Unleash your hero's ultra attack to steal enemies' souls, allowing you take their form. Discover brand new move sets and character styles as you capture over 30 enemies, each as complex and advanced as the three heroes. Work as a community to defeat the final boss together. When the collective community of Abyss Odyssey players defeats the final boss enough times, his mask breaks to reveal a new identity. Each time this is achieved, new content will be unlocked in game, including new enemies and other dynamics. Beautiful visuals inspired by Art Nouveau, showcasing a story rich in Chilean culture. The flowing lines and beautiful organic styling of Art Nouveau can be seen from the game's UI to its character design. Set in late 19th-century Santiago, those characters and the game's story also draw heavy inspiration from Chilean folklore and mythology. Play the campaign solo or with a friend in online or local cooperative multiplayer. A second player can drop in or drop out at any time to join you in your journey down the Abyss. Bonus versus mode allows up to 4 players to test their skills against each other. Fight it out in special arenas developed for free-for-all or team-based competitive multiplayer. Use any character you've unlocked in game, hero or enemy, for dozens of characters to choose from. ","$14.99"

It also deals with extremely mature themes, including depression and thoughts of suicide. Similar to other forms of art that tackle these issues, Actual Sunlight can be an extremely powerful emotional experience – before downloading it, please first consider what your reaction to a book, film or piece of music in a similar vein might be.

Indecision is your enemy and empathy is your weapon in a quest to earn one last chance to win back the love of your life. Circumstance Choose from characters of different gender, race, and sexual preference and live through the common experiences and unique hardships of each based on your selection. NPCs may treat you differently based on your gender, race, or sexual preference opening and closing different paths along the way. Consequence Each playthrough is filled with a staggering number of diverging paths that can be discovered through both overt actions and subtle choices in conversation. The journey you experience will be tailored to your personal ethical compass as your decisions both conscious and subconscious change your fate. http://store.steampowered.com/app/274310/ Reviews “Always Sometimes Monsters deals in chaos and quantum theories – in every second of our lives, we make choices that forever impact our timelines going forward, dictating whether we keep or lose friends, maintain a job or succeed in our goals. We are the masters of our destinies, Always Sometimes Monsters says – but we can't control other people's lives. That's where it gets tricky.” 4/5 – Joystiq “It's an earnest look at life under tough economic pressure, at love when things don't go according to plan and at a creative career during its shittiest lows. It has a lot to say, and importantly, it speaks from the heart.” 8/10 – Polygon “Always Sometimes Monsters isn't the first game to get clever with morality. It's not the first game that's had a few grey areas. It also isn't about either of those. It's about perspective. It's about empathy. It's about who we are and why we do what we do. That narrative is one of contradiction and hypocrisy, because that's what real people are about.” 9/10 – Eurogamer ","Free To Play"

AFF focuses on team-oriented tactical gameplay and objective-based scenarios with a high degree of replayability, featuring: Wide selection of weapons and tools, ground vehicles and spacecraft to fight with. Diverse combat opportunities - assume point to clear a building, hunt with a frigate wolfpack as a lineship captain, issue orders from the bridge of your battleship. Fully operational and pilotable capital ships with playable interiors. Unique combination of spaceship and infantry combat - board spacestations, shipyards and vessels to capture or destroy them from the inside. Dogfighting using space interceptors and bombers, launched from capital ships and stations. Gameplay mechanics designed as a mix of modern elements (customization, loadouts, persistence) and inspirations from classic shooters (frantic, fast-paced firefights). Commander mode for issuing orders to your squadmates and teammates. Full AI support - all scenarios can be played both offline and online identically, supporting up to 64 players or bots filling in for the players if required. Rich science fiction universe setting. Another space game? Well, we've been doing this a long time - AFF has been a rich universe of fiction and art since 2005. We made a Homeworld mod, and kept building from there. Work started on an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, but was then ported over to UT3 in 2007, culminating in a 3rd place grand prize in 2009's MakeSomethingUnreal contest. Angels Fall First as a standalone game is, for us, a mission to enable the player to do as much as possible in a vast environment - whilst still retaining the focussed, fun experience of match based FPS games. Way back in the back-whens, we loved Tie Fighter. A little later on, we loved Battlefield. We waited patiently for the game which would inevitably unite the vast scale and spacefights with the close and personal firefights and thunderous vehicle battles... But it never really appeared. Many games came close, but there was always some part missing. You couldn’t get out of your spaceship, you couldn’t get into your spaceship, you had big spaceships but you couldn’t run around in them, you could run around in your big spaceship but you couldn’t fly it and so on and so forth and gahd damMIT! Where was our spacefight groundfight game? So, we set ourselves to work. AFF exists because it MUST exist. Only in AFF can you spawn in your crew quarters, run to the bay watching the space fight out of the windows, launch a dropship, fight through the defenders to the enemy flagship, breach the hull, run and gun your way to the bridge and SHOOT THE ENEMY CAPTAIN IN THE BACK OF THE NECK. Calm Down! Ok. But it's this slightly twitchy passion which has driven us to create such a monster. We grew old making this, and we got grumpy watching everyone else release their cool games or whatever. We're from a time when games were about blowing stuff up for points and glory and now FINALLY we want to go out there and share this crazy passion with all of you!","$17.99"

"Apollo4x","app","Apollo4x is a casual-to-difficult space trading tycoon game, where success is measured in earnings from how efficient your trade routes are in transporting supplies to demands on your planets. Combat is card based, and uses a unique system never before seen.","May 5, 2015","Digital Entertainment","Digital Entertainment,Digital Entertainment","Strategy,Indie,Casual,Simulation,Grand Strategy,Action,Great Soundtrack,RPG,Adventure,4X","Single-player,Steam Trading Cards,Captions available,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Stats,Includes level editor,Commentary available","English",NA,"Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie,RPG,Simulation,Strategy"," About This Game Apollo4x is a game of transporting 5 resources between planets, and you have limited fuel to do so.  It's a bit puzzle, a bit resource management, and some tycoon strategy.  There are no build queues, and you are having meaningful interaction with your economy every single turn.  There are no ""other players"" to compete against, but we've instead used a ""time pressure"" type enemy that consumes planets as it spreads across the map - because a fun game needs a challenge component, and we find symmetric AI opponents problematic in other games, so this was the best solution.  Difficulty is fully in your control, and ranges from zero-challenge to something the creators can't beat, so you'll find your own best settings with experience. Apollo4x has ""4X"" in the title, but this is not an indicator that we've made a ""traditional formula"" title like Master of Orion, or the games that follow that economic and combat model.  Steam has a multitude of games that do, and do it so well that there's no point in us making a competitor to them. The Idea What we did is toss out the economic model of exploring a hidden map, having AI opponents that attempt to play the same game as the player (because they generally fail, and obviously cheat) and long build queues where you just hit ""next turn"" 100 times before anything significant happens.  Rather than have you build a navy of spaceships and militarily conquer other simulated players, we made more of a tycoon puzzle economy.  Each planet has three ""exports"" and you put two ""imports"" on them.  Money is made by matching exports on one planet to imports on another, with the limitation of fuel availability, which is dependent on how upgraded each planet is. The Enemy Since we don't have simulated players to compete against, we decided on using a ""creeping doom"" style opponent.  The enemy spreads out organically from their homeworld(s) at a pace you determine in the difficulty settings.  You can, and will have to, slow their spread and defend your own planets from this steadily encroaching threat.  Each enemy colony adds +1 army to their homeworld defense, so the player is encouraged to keep the enemy from growing into an impossible strength and speed of expansion by ""pruning"" their colonies.  If your chosen win condition is to cleanse the galaxy of them entirely, you'll have to weaken them first through attrition. Combat We went out of the 4X realm and built in a tactical card game inspired in part by some of our favorite tabletop combat games.  Morale, combined arms, and multiple possible tactics for each of the very unique units to choose from every turn.  Four different enemy clans to battle, based on the four horsemen - death, war, pestilence and famine.  Each has an entirely different set of units and tactics and requires a completely different battle plan to beat.  War fights with brute force, while pestilence attacks with morale crushing horror weapons, and death gave up their bodies for machines and now are the unliving reapers.  Currently there is no space combat or fleet building, being instead like Starship Troopers where your troops are ""dropped in"" and just fight the ground war.  This is to keep things simple and not have two different combat systems in a game that's primarily a trading puzzle - but if Apollo4X does well, it's on the list for whatever sequel we make. Winning Winning the game is accomplished by either economic or military means.  You can kill all the enemy homeworlds.  Alternately, stockpile 300 of each market resource, or upgrade your colonies to produce a cumulative 500 ""stellar network"" points and colonize 20 planets.  Military, economic, or expansion victory is your choice. Game Difficulty Finally, we allowed you maximum choice of difficulty.  Tailor the game to your needs, so you feel challenged but not overwhelmed.  If you think the economy could be more resistive, turn it up.  If you want to not worry about enemy expansion you can weaken them, start them with less colonies, or lower rate of expansion.  Or, if you really like the combat game, set the economy to easy and add all four enemy types to the map at maximum strength -- good luck with that, though.  If you want to go fully casual, we even allow you to turn off economic failure, and have unlimited funds to experiment with.  We, as players ourselves, lose interest in games that are too hard or too easy, so it seemed important to give the player full control of it.  Since most people want to play on ""average"", we'll be listening to feedback about which difficulty settings are most popular and adjust the ""average"" levels to those trends down the road a bit. We dared to be different in a genre full of excellent but too similar titles.  If different is what you need, this is it.","$1.99"

Aqua Kitty was made by a core team of two people with audio created by Electric Cafe and the game box art by artist David Hankin. It began as a small modern-retro styled PC game, designed to run at a crisp 1280x720 it was created with a love of the 16bit gaming era and late 80s video arcade games. There were originally 3 core versions of the game available of different hardware - PC, XBox360 and Sony PSM. Sony version is the oldest and smallest version. A critically acclaimed launch title for PSM (Vita). XBox version is the Sony version with extra added levels + enemies + refinements. PC version is the most feature rich and improves on the XBox one with new Weapons + Gradius style Arcade mode + yet further refinements and extra details (with the Steam version being unique in having online leaderboards and achievements). All the new things we have added to the Steam version will also be rolled back into the other PC versions unless Steam specific (ie Online leaderboards, achievements, trading cards are STEAM ONLY).","$6.99"

They have only the clothes on their backs and a cart filled with supplies from their homeland.  The townspeople of Banished are your primary resource. They are born, grow older, work, have children of their own, and eventually die. Keeping them healthy, happy, and well-fed are essential to making your town grow. Building new homes is not enough—there must be enough people to move in and have families of their own.  Banished has no skill trees. Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so. There is no money. Instead, your hard-earned resources can be bartered away with the arrival of trade vessels. These merchants are the key to adding livestock and annual crops to the townspeople’s diet; however, their lengthy trade route comes with the risk of bringing illnesses from abroad.  There are twenty different occupations that the people in the city can perform from farming, hunting, and blacksmithing, to mining, teaching, and healing. No single strategy will succeed for every town. Some resources may be more scarce from one map to the next. The player can choose to replant forests, mine for iron, and quarry for rock, but all these choices require setting aside space into which you cannot expand.  The success or failure of a town depends on the appropriate management of risks and resources.","$19.99"

"BeamNG.drive","app","A dynamic soft-body physics vehicle simulator capable of doing just about anything.","May 29, 2015","BeamNG","BeamNG,BeamNG","Early Access,Simulation,Driving,Physics,Destruction,Realistic,Racing,Open World,Sandbox,Moddable,Singleplayer,Early Access,First-Person,Funny,Third Person,Action,Multiplayer,Adventure,Casual,Free to Play","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Includes level editor","English",7,"Racing,Simulation,Early Access"," About This Game BeamNG. drive is a realistic, immersive driving game offering near-limitless possibilities. Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior. The driving feel is authentic and visceral, and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism. Environments and vehicles in BeamNG. drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving. We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG. drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be. Why is BeamNG. drive the game for you? As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG. drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in. In some ways, BeamNG. drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games don't let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG. drive gives you the gameplay you want, and doesn't force you to do anything that you don't think is fun or interesting. The future of the game and our physics engine As we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor. We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim. Also, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics. All the flex that happens to a real plane's airframe arises naturally in BeamNG, and the consequences of excessive stress are also modeled. Fly too fast and your wings will start to bend and rip off. The potential for the BeamNG physics engine is huge. Alpha Access Features  All future updates to BeamNG. drive included for free (alpha, beta), also including the final game  Soft-body physics sandbox  19 detailed, customizable, destructible vehicles, with more to come  10 terrains to explore and drive across, with more to come  Frequent updates adding terrains, vehicles, features, gameplay, and bug fixes  Full modding and content creation capabilities - make maps and vehicles, and script gameplay  Use the built-in terrain editor and any 3D modeling, image editing, and text editing software  Online authentication is only necessary to update; the game itself does not need an internet connection to run. Alpha Testers Users that already entered the alpha testing via our website can get a free Steam key. Our goals Our main focus is on how things move rather than how things look on the screen. We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation, making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this, we are designing the engine and corresponding assets, so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and operating system. Right now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration, but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL. Our mission To have realistic, accurate, destructible, and malleable physics everywhere. To make anything possible.

Spencer. Time has not been kind to Spencer: Five years after his heroic defeat of the Imperials, he has been betrayed by the government he swore to serve, imprisoned for crimes he didn't commit, and sentenced to death. On the very day of Spencer's execution, terrorists detonate a massive experimental weapon in Ascension City, unleashing an intense earthquake that has turned the city into rubble and wiped out its population. With the terrain in ruins and the city's air defense grid now in the control of a massive terrorist force whose goal remains unclear, the FSA have only one option left - a behind-the-lines assault. It's the perfect job for a Bionic Commando.

From the creators of Vincere Totus Astrum comes a universe of exploration and adventure. As the Captain of your own Starship begin your journey of literally endless worlds by first selecting and editing your randomly generated race and ship, then set out for the stars. Encounter alien races and exotic locations as you travel in an endlessly procedurally generated galaxy. No two game are the same. As you explore, randomly generated “Episodes” will have you fighting hostile ships, helping aliens and exploring the surface of new planets. How long can you survive the deep of space? How far can you travel? Who knows what is waiting for you! Your journey begins now! Setting out to the stars! The game starts with players selecting a Home Star from the intro screen galaxy view. From there you zoom into your new system and select a homeworld. The type of the star and the kind of planet you select orbiting it determines some of the base stats of your race. A low gravity cool and wet world tends to produce sentient species that are more docile in nature, where as more hostile environments lead to more aggressive races. These differences help decide how battle-hardened they are or how adept at science they may be etc. From these base stats a player then sets out to determine the look of their race through a set of procedurally generated tools and what kind of society they come from. All of your decisions up to this point help affect what your ship will turn out like. Using procedural generation the game creates unique ship designs which you can edit. Design choices affect a ship's capabilities and stats. Once you're done, it's time to set out amongst the stars. Bit Odyssey is designed to be endless... Well, endless if you are a good Starship Captain, that is. Players could select one direction and keep on going, if they choose to do so. The way you lose, of course, is getting killed or running out of resources. As you travel, make sure to orbit some stars and collect fuel. Damaged and need repairs? Visit a planet rich in minerals and mine for them, or trade with a local spacefarer. Exploration in itself is fun, but throughout your star hopping you will encounter randomly activated ""Episode triggers"". The triggers are the starting point for an adventure that is created procedurally from the Mission Matrix. For instance, you may locate a plasma trail during interstellar travel. The bridge crew would then ask you if you would like to investigate. If you choose yes, then the game may take you to a ship in distress in an asteroid field, or one that is under attack or has crashed on a planet. From there, your choices affect the rest of the episode. Attacking the damaged vessel will mark you an enemy of that race whereas tractoring them out makes them a friend. Features Galaxy is big And when I say big I mean really big like a never ending Galaxy with stars, planets, nebula and other space phenomenon. Do you have that ship in a different color? Yes we can do that with our procedural generation algorithms. Everything from the planets and stars to ships and races is created on the fly. And then to take it step further we provide you tools to edit your Ship and your race. Lets fire blue particle cannons full... Engage in battles of one on up to three enemy vessels. Cool thing is with the Mission Matrix, a ship might jump out of battle and you may get the option to chase them, once you catch up you may finish them off or two of his friends might be waiting for you. You think they have apples on an alien planet? I don't know if apples will be there, but the idea is that you can explore endless alien worlds and conduct various away missions. Planets will contain unique items that your science officer can scan, and your engineer can collect to bring back to the ship for trade. Making Friends will be important Talk, trade and assisting other spacefarers will benefit you as each race you encounter will store an enemy, neutral or friend status. That will effect how your next encounter with them will be. Episodes for everyone! In Bit Odyssey we have worked on creating a generator that creates randomized missions or as we call it, episodes. Each episode last around 3-8 minutes on average and include everything from search and rescue, transport, battles and more. Imagine receiving a distress signal, then approaching a ship to discover it's a trap. After defeating them and searching the ship discover that the stranded crew is on a nearby planet. The unique Mission Matrix generates over a 100 different ""episode"" types and puts them together. Stuff is cool... Player will be able to collect and store unique plants, materials and relics you discover on your journey. And trade them for other resources or information. #MadewithFusion ","$4.99"

Blitzkrieg is the latest development in WWII real-time strategy gaming combining flexibility, historic accuracy and endless playability into one of the most challenging and enjoyable games yet! Blitzkrieg's unique and completely flexible campaign structure puts you in control of deciding how your forces will fare in each of the major engagements that comprise three central Campaigns.

Historical accuracy is pushed to the edge as each unit is endowed with the actual capabilities and characteristics that existed at the time. Details such as the thickness of a tank's armor down to the range of infantry rifles add a level of previously unprecedented realism. Each campaign has been meticulously researched to provide an accurate depiction of the battles that took place, while still maintaining the flexibility (and fun!) necessary to let you play the way you want.

Having artists for parents, who read us vivid fantasy stories at bedtime, I developed an obsessive appreciation for fairy tales, woods and magical kingdoms.  Because of this, nature, as well as fantasy has been a prominent influence on my work. Having been born with synesthesia, it did not take long for me to discover that all things of visual beauty can be described through sound.  I got my first keyboard when I was 8, and taught myself how to play.  By the time I was 14, I had composed nearly 100 original pieces, in an attempt to communicate my passion through music. Although my goal in music has always been to capture, recapture and convey the wonder I felt as a child, while exploring woods and gardens, the single most influential thing in my life as a composer has been video game music.  This medium has been an endless source of delight for me, as the soundtracks underscoring the many electronic worlds I have explored over the years have demonstrated to me that I am by no means alone in my desire: I long to share with others the joys of discovery, epic sensations of wonder and enchantment as well as the sweetness and beauty of unique aesthetics, environments and themes by painting colorful and fantastical landscapes in sound. I would say that the vast majority of my work (now over 1500 songs and counting) convey emotions existing on the “enchantment” spectrum.  My work is often dreamy, ethereal, soft, soothing, mysterious, meandering and (usually, but not always) joyful.  However, as seen in my BFS (Blob From Space) tracks, I like to sometimes write weird and fun, retro style video game music.  It’s my hope to write many video game soundtracks, because it's my hope that my dreams will live on through my music- but I won't stop creating it any time soon.  I will compose until I die!""

From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more. Braid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world. Key features:  Newly added Steam Cloud support  Save your in-progress game to the cloud, then play where you left off from on any Steam connected computer.  Forgiving yet challenging gameplay:  Braid is a 2-D platform game where you can never die and never lose. Despite this, Braid is challenging — but the challenge is about solving puzzles, rather than forcing you to replay tricky jumps.  Rich puzzle environment:  Travel through a series of worlds searching for puzzle pieces, then solving puzzles by manipulating time: rewinding, creating parallel universes, setting up pockets of dilated time. The gameplay feels fresh and new; the puzzles are meant to inspire new ways of thinking.  Aesthetic design:  A painterly art style and lush, organic soundtrack complement the unique gameplay.  Nonlinear story:  A nonlinear fiction links the various worlds and provides real-world metaphors for your time manipulations; in turn, your time manipulations are projections of the real-world themes into playful ""what-if"" universes where consequences can be explored.  Nonlinear gameplay:  The game doesn't force you to solve puzzles in order to proceed. If you can't figure something out, just play onward and return to that puzzle later. ","$14.99"

It is the mid 1950s and the race for dominance between the US and the Soviet Union is about to move into a new dimension: space. Take charge of the US or Soviet space agencies - your duty is be the first to the moon. Carefully manage your budget by opening programs, spending R&D funds on improving the hardware, recruiting personnel and launching space missions in this realistic turn based strategy game. Road to the Moon features the race to the Moon, the historical event that started in the early 1960s and that ended in July 1969, after the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission. The game features both a campaign and a sandbox mode. In campaign mode, you will be able to play as the Director of either NASA or the Soviet Space Agency in order to beat the other side to be the first on the Moon. You can also lead the  Global Space Agency (GSA), an fictional space agency that combines programs from all the major space agencies in the world . In the GSA campaign, you will need to address the requests and short-term goals issued by government, and is geared towards those players who prefer a game experience focused on exploration instead of competition.  Alternatively, all three space agencies feature a Sandbox mode, which provides a more open-ended experience and allows you to try out different approaches without any political pressure. You will be able to develop dozens of programs. Some examples include the X-15 and the PKA space planes, the Sputnik satellite, the Mercury, Voskhod, Apollo and Soyuz manned spacecraft and the Mars Viking probe. You are not limited to missions that did launch, as as the game also allows you to try out many concepts that were planned but that never left the drawing board. For example, instead of sending men to the Moon using the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) approach used by Project Apollo in the late 1960s and early 1970s, you will be able to rewrite history and use either the alternative Gemini Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) or Gemini Direct Ascent (DA) schemes. The number of options available ensure every game will be different and there is huge replay value. To verify its accuracy and authenticity, the game, is being developed in consultation with Dr. Buzz Aldrin, former U.S. Air Force combat pilot (66 missions in Korea) and NASA astronaut, who took part in the first Moon landing mission and became the second human being to walk on the Moon. If you have any interest in space exploration and the events that transpired during the 'Race to the Moon', this is a game you just do not want to miss! Features Three different campaign modes: play as NASA or the Soviet space agency in order to be the first on the Moon or play as the Global Space Agency (GSA) and deal with the short-term objectives issued by politicians. Manage all aspects of your space agencies from their inception in the 1950's through to the manned lunar landing missions Play the race to the Moon campaign mode against other players using Slitherine’s PBEM system. The Sandbox mode allows you to play as  any of the three space agencies and removes all competition restrictions. You will have a fully featured playground in order to try out different approaches to space exploration! Create space programs and launch missions inspired by real programs such as the X-15 Space plane, the Sputnik satellite, the Gemini, Vostok and Apollo manned spacecraft and a lot more! Research and develop dozens of mission components from several program categories. Develop your facility with advanced structures and upgrades including the Vehicle Assembly Building and the Mission Control Centre. Recruit and train astronaut candidates and assign them to missions. Assemble an elite team of Scientists, Engineers, Technicians (SET), Flight Controllers for the best chance of success. Manage your agency's budget. Mission components have an associated reliability factor and can cause catastrophic failures. Vast amounts of historical research ensure that the game's huge database features missions that launched and many more that never left the drawing board! A vast array of components built in 3D and rendered out in exquisite detail allow you to follow the progress of your missions via animated sequences. The Buzz-opedia gives background information on the real programs, missions and hardware throughout the game.

There are different economic strategy games and they can be broken down to subtypes but from our viewpoint Caesar encompasses planning, constructing, diplomacy and military campaigns. Economy and Trade Miniature model of an economy leaves the ruler no room for mistakes, under his leadership there are extractive industry (mines, sawmills, outcrop mines and farms) and production (factories, armories, wineries and brandy kitchens). And if some resource is scarce or not available, then trade with the neighbors can be a solution for the difficult situation. Mini-economy is complicated and takes into account a variety of facts: taxes, import/export, population of the town, healthcare, unemployment. In order to stay in the black it is necessary to develop houses with high income level but that can lead to a rise in unemployment which consequently results in big problems such as an embezzlement of municipal purse. Construction Construction is defined by the needs of the town, healthcare, procurement, buildings security provision. The main idea of construction is bringing workers to the area, there actors entertain the public, engineer provides service for shabby houses, vigils fight criminals.  Moreover, city folk prefer to occupy quiet picturesque location such as gardens farther from dirty barns and noisy barracks. Diplomacy  The emperor will not leave the town alone, Caesar himself will demand goods for his personal use, sometimes in huge amounts and with bad timing. If the player has enough nerve he/she can just turn a blind eye to Caesar which unfortunately results in game over. Therefore, it is important to stay friends with Caesar and send him presents such as modest donations or exotic animals. Towns in the neighborhood will also take part in common trade network of the Empire and compete in the deals with the town. Religion Romans were superstitions people and created the whole hierarchy of gods. 5 gods are in the game: - Earth goddess, Ceres, when worshiped in the right way doubles the yield capacity. - Restive Neptune can help the merchants have a successful voyage. - Sly Mercurius can fill all barns and storage houses up to the roof. - Spirit of Mars protects the town from foes brave enough to attack the town. - Venus can brighten up the mood of city folk for a long time. Attitude of the City Folk The attitude of the city folk to you will be very important, if the reputation of the ruler is bad it can start the emigration, then criminal rate increases - riots, fires and many other problems occur. Therefore, it is necessary to take care of the people and analyse current deficiency. Healthcare is provided by hospitals and bath houses. Entertainment is fence play and chariot-riding. Food comes from farms and the sea. Religion and security are at control of the regular army. Military Set-up The city has to be protected from invasions of barbarians, the creation of bastille lies ahead, soldiers and barracks can be situated there as well as recruit depot. However, this is a way to recruit only varmint velites and reckless equites. Roman army is its legionnaires and they are heavily armored with helmets and shields that means a demand for ore and iron which are not so easy to excavate. But even if you have 2 cohorts of legionnaires nobody is free of fear therefore there is a need in a military academy where soldiers can have additional training in survival and ethics. Specific Features: + Upload of the map from the original Caesar III game; + Construction\demolition of buildings and edifices; + Migration of population; + Farming and product distribution; + Entertainment, healthcare, religion, education; + Empire trade network with computer towns; + Extraction of raw materials and manufacturing; + Prefects, engineers, apprentices, soldiers, etc.; + Advisers; + Dynamic town modeling; + Changing the level of the houses according to the environment; + Healthcare and water facilities; + Military buildings.

Discover a spaceship MOBA game with 2D combat in 3D environment, wide variety of play styles and fun gameplay for casual and pro gamers alike.  We wanted to make something that we ourselves would like to play - a game chock-full of what’s cool about spaceships shooting each other up and with none of that boring stuff. We set out to make a game with both a light-hearted gameplay that is hard to find today and deep tactical potential that allows for sophisticated approach to team play. So we made Cannons Lasers Rockets - a fast-paced, bright and colorful space arcade equally enjoyable for hardcore and casual gamers.  In our game you will discover that:  SPACE COMBAT IS EASY A videogame spaceship is usually not an easy ride - three-dimensional navigation makes you dizzy and disoriented. But in CLR you struggle against your opponents, not against your controls. We simplified gameplay just enough so you wouldn’t need to BE a great star pilot to FEEL like one.  SPACE COMBAT IS INTERESTING No boring parts, only what you come for - going into combat to send some rockets into the other guy’s hull. And if you eventually get a little tired of shooting, and start looking for more - be sure that we will give you more. Multiple game modes, a metric ton of different tactical situations, a MOBA core that creates many possibilities for fun and meaningful gameplay - and even more!  SPACE COMBAT IS FUN We don’t really know what «realistic» starships will look like, so we don’t really care. A ship in a game should be fun to look at and fun to ride in, period. We want ships to be weird, plentiful and different - everyone will find one that is suited just for them, both in visual style and the distinct way of playing that comes with every ship.

In every event you have the option to “play it your way”… Waste all your opponents, kill every pedestrian, or (perish the thought) complete all the laps. Oh and watch out – the cops in their super-tough armoured patrol vehicles are lurking, and if they catch you being bad they’ll be down on you like several tons of cold pork.

The aim is for the player to work their way up the ranking system, from 99th place to first. The player vehicle is pitted against a number of computer controlled competitors, in locations such as cities, mines and desert towns. Levels can be beaten in one of three ways: Completing all the laps of the race course, as one would a normal racing game. ""Wasting"" (wrecking) all the opponents vehicles. Killing all the pedestrians in the area. Each level has a time limit, but more time may be gained by passing through checkpoints, collecting powerups, damaging/destroying the competitors' cars, and by running over pedestrians (with bonuses awarded for style). These actions also reward the player with Credits, which can be used to make instant repairs or recover the car (after falling down a chasm, for example). They can also be used to upgrade Armour, Power and Offense stats in the Parts Shop between races. This is also the time to switch which car to drive if others have been obtained. As well as opponents partaking in the 'race', some levels also contain a number of heavily armored Cop Cars, which will activate their sirens and hound the player when provoked. They can be attacked and destroyed, but do not count as opponents. A single ""Super Squad Car"" exists in one level, and it can be claimed if destroyed. An Action Replay with multiple camera viewpoints is available at any point during a race. Carmageddon won the “Game of the Year” trophy in the 1997 PC Zone Reader awards. Carmageddon 1 & 2 were “Driving Game of the Year” 1997/1998. SELECTED REVIEWS OF THE ORIGINAL GAME Originally released for the PC in 1997, Carmageddon was an instant hit and the titles went on to sell over 2 million copies worldwide. Here’s what a sample of the gaming press thought at the time: “Carmageddon is visceral, violent, vehicular fun...” - GameSpot 8.8 out of 10 “Carmageddon, to get straight to the point, is one of the best computer games I've ever played… Carmageddon is God!” - Duncan McDonald 95% Classic Award PC Zone Magazine “Carmageddon is one of those games that only come along once in a blue moon. An essential purchase.” - Escape Magazine 6 out of 6 “The gameplay is spot on and anyone with a dark enough sense of humour should give it a go.” - Computer Gaming World 4 out of 5 “So next time you gun down coppers on GTA VI, just remember, Carmageddon’s controversy was there first, and you have a lot to thank it for.” - RetroGarden Carmageddon is the first of a series of graphically violent driving-oriented video games. It was conceived and developed by Stainless Games, published by SCi and released June 30, 1997 on PC & Mac. It was, and remains, a poster child for video game controversy. The controversy surrounded the game's central premise; that of earning reward for running down innocent pedestrians. The game was notable for its realistic and ground-breaking physics, and for its in-game action replay features. It was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox 3D driving game, and may have influenced other later games including the Driver and Grand Theft Auto series. ABOUT STAINLESS GAMES Stainless was founded in 1994 by Patrick Buckland, a veteran of the games industry going back to the Jurassic period of 1982, and Neil Barnden, who used to have hair like a mammoth. A team of 8 worked on the original Carmageddon at Stainless, and 5 are still with the company today, although a couple of them are now kept manacled in a small padded room in the cellar. Stainless Games now employs around one hundred mad, dedicated people of assorted gender, height and width. They can all be found dangling precariously from a small chalky rock just off the South Coast of England. http://www.carmageddon.com/bugger http://www.carmageddon.com ","$9.99"

It is a turn based regional game with an emphasis on playability and historical accuracy. It is built on the renowned AGE game engine, with a modern and intuitive interface that makes it easy to learn yet hard to master. This  historical operational strategy game with a simultaneous turn-based engine (WEGO system) that places players at the head of the USA or CSA during the American Civil War (1861-1865). You take the part of the military and political leadership, trying to lead your nation to victory, in the midst of some of the toughest operations of the Civil War. You will build, organize and command your armies over one of the largest maps of the USA ever made for a Civil War game. There are a host of real military leaders to appoint with their own strengths and weaknesses and choosing the right man for the job is crucial. However you are not just a military leader and must make vital economics and political decisions. These can have far reaching effects and you can even influence foreign intervention from the French & British who were constantly intervening in America for power and prestige. Each turn lasts 2 weeks and you must issue your orders in advance, planning on where the enemy will be, not where they are now – which is called a WEGO system (We Go at the same time). Orders are executed simultaneously in 14 phases – 1 per day. Battles are resolved on the day they occur so scheduling the arrival of your forces and planning the logistics or your army are key to success. You can send a massive force to assault an enemy position but if you do not carefully plan the attack you can have you troops arriving piecemeal and being easily dispatched. The WEGO system adds excitement and suspense and is far more realistic than traditional turn based games. This is must have game for anyone interested in the period or grand strategy games in general. Features Setting: the game covers all of the USA, from the Eastern seaboard to the Rockies, from 1861 to 1865.

Gateway to Caen focuses on the largest, concentrated British offensive since the Normandy landings in an attempt to penetrate the German lines west of Caen and cross the Odon River to get the stalled advance moving again. With Close Combat: Gateway to Caen you can play at the strategic and tactical level, putting yourself in the boots of both the generals and the platoon commanders. You can move or combine your battlegroups on the strategic level and decide the outcome of battles on the tactical level. You will command squads in close combat situations, using small arms, mortars, machine guns, armored cars, and tanks to triumph against the enemy. You command artillery and mortar barrages and even air strikes. You will get to know individual solders, platoons, battalions, and the larger brigades and battle groups which they comprise. Players can experience the desperate situation of the outnumbered, but well-armed Panzergrenadiers, or the daunting offensive mission of the fully-supported British infantry advancing across the treacherous Odon Valley. At your command are Churchill, Cromwell, Firefly, Sherman, Stuart tanks and more. Panther, Tiger, Stug, and Mk.IV tanks will arrive to support German Panzergrenadiers as they try to hold the line against a concerted British attack. The historic scope of Operation Epsom is captured in single battles, operations, and the grand campaign. The strategic battlefield offers over two dozen individual battlefields with over three dozen accurately portrayed German and British battle groups. British infantry regimental history is reflected in name among the various battalions. You can deploy your battalions as they actually fought in the struggle for the Odon. The game includes all new maps and a range of upgraded effects. The Setting With the success of the Allied landings at Normandy and their domination of air and sea, expectations were high that the momentum would continue on land. It was not to be so. Though initially surprised and overwhelmed, the German Army quickly recovered, mobilized, and, counterattacked. Field Marshal Rommel formed a capable defense in Normandy that made the Allied advance costly. Superior Allied artillery and air power failed to crack the German lines. Though the Norman City of Caen was originally a British D-Day objective, its capture would elude and frustrate Montgomery’s 21st Army for weeks to come. Operation Epsom was Field Marshall Montgomery’s first concentrated attempt to go around the city and the Odon River, and break through the strengthening German bulwark. The newly-arrived British VIII Corps, supported by 700 guns of the Royal Artillery made a go of it along a four-mile front between Rauray and Carpiquet. Defending that front was the infamous 12th SS Panzer Division. Though reduced by weeks of heavy fighting they remained a potent and experienced foe. The Germans had offensive plans too, but the British struck first, and the 2nd SS Panzer Corps, the last of Germany’s offensive reserves in Normandy, was instead committed to stopping the British breakthrough along the Odon. Can you, as Montgomery and his commanders, re-chart the course of the Normandy campaign and prevail against Germany’s SS Panzer divisions?  Can you as the Germans, once again stop Montgomery, or eclipse history and push the British back entirely? Features Completely revised graphics that elevate battle effects, units, and maps to a new, detailed level in the Close Combat Series. Thirty new battlefield maps accurately reflect the Odon Valley west of Caen, France. 65 vehicles, 36 infantry units, 77 weapons. New vehicles and guns including Churchill, Cromwell, M-10 Achilles, and Firefly tanks; 17-pdr AT guns, Loyd Carriers, and more. Improved graphics and effects and new soldier voices. Revised terrain files that represent the specific conditions of the Odon battlefield: tall cornfields and hindered, muddy movement during rainy weather.

However, a creepy new resident, Mr Grim Reaper, looks set to turn retirement on its head. After years trawling the earth for souls to harvest, Mr Grim Reaper concludes Sunny Pines is where he’ll lay his hat, where he can harvest souls from the comfort of his rocking chair. However, seven of the sprightliest senior citizens have other ideas and set out to prove that life for Grim in Sunny Pines definitely won't be like shooting fish in a barrel.  The stately seven decide to strike a deal with the Grim Reaper; a mobility scooter racing championship to the death. If they can prove themselves to be fast and full of life, surviving and ultimately winning the championship, then he will allow them to live. However, too slow and they will be condemned to the retirement village in the sky.

The object of the game is to become the dominant major power throughout the world. Players can be one among six of the great powers of the time: Great Britain, Germany, France, USA, Japan or Russia. Features Return to the era of Golden Warfare and rule one of handful of powers which had been shaping the face of our present world. Sail, ride and march across the globe as your nation flexes its military and economic muscles. Supplement brawn with subterfuge and use cloak and dagger tactics such as subversion and espionage. Compete with the European hegemons in their final golden days before they engulfed the world in the flames of the first global war. Play as one of the then two raising behemoths: the United States of America or Imperial Japan; or as one of the main European power to roll them back within their boundaries. Play against the AI or other human claimants to the mastery of our planet. More about the game You win by either scoring the most Victory Points (VPs) or being the first to reach a certain preset VP threshold, depending on scenario and custom choices in the main menu. To do so, you must capture regions over the world, and defeat your enemies in battle. The world has about 130 regions open to conquest. The regions have variable income and VP values (set randomly in the Standard scenario) and unknown until conquered or spied upon. Each region not owned by a Major Power usually has an independent Minor country owning and defending it. Each Major country is controlled by a human player or the computer, or is designated neutral and then acts as a Minor country. Hotseat play is possible, with an option to limit to 4.00 minutes the playing time per player. Each game turn represents roughly one season. Game lasts till victory conditions are achieved. Scenarios: game offers 3 scenarios: one starting in the year 1880 with an historical setting, one in 1914 with historical positions, and an open ca-1870 standard where nation only own their starting home territories (free-for-all non-historical) The game has 3 main phases, each player entering them in sequence, i.e. Build Phase (Spring only, with: Army & Navy Construction, Fortification, Economic Aid, Espionage, Subversion),  Movement Phase (Army & Navy),  and Combat Phase. Gameplay of each phase is rather simple and straightforward, as follows: Army and Navy Build Phase (Spring):  Create new armies and fleets in your Supply Centers Fortification Phase (Spring): Fortify army units (except in Supply Centers which are already fortified). Economic Aid Phase (Spring): Lend money to other Major countries; which is added to their Treasury. Or Lend money to neutral Minor countries; which they use immediately to build armies. Espionage Phase (Spring): Learn the approximate (not always accurate) army strength and the income of a Minor country or of an region controlled by a Major country. And the region’s VP value Subversion Phase (Spring): Spend money to bribe a Minor country's army, weakening the country's defense or causing a coup (giving you control of the said country in return). Movement Phase (All turns): Move armies to adjacent regions only. Move navies alone or with armies from one port to another (or carry regiments to amphibious landings on enemy holdings). Combat Phase (All turns): up to twenty rounds of battle; each consists of naval (if ships are present) then land battles ","$9.99"

We recognize this, and we recognize the role that music will play in interactive storytelling as the medium grows from its current state of infancy. In most games, music is an afterthought. Something which is created and produced, often separately from the game production. With such evocative titles as “Battle music,” “Exploration music,” etc., it is often placed into the game piecemeal wherever it happens to ""sound good"". Jeremy Soule has always approached his games with a keen eye, and a steady determination to advance the role that music plays. His scores are spellbinding, embodying the spirit of whatever work he is contributing to, and his standards are impeccable. We approached the score for CONSORTIUM in much the same way one would a film. The non-linear and branching nature of the game means that players will experience the story in their own way, from their perspective.  Jeremy’s music will always be there, complimenting what you’re doing, playing with your emotions. There are musical foreshadowing and powerful thematic moments that will help you to interpret the events and unravel the mystery. This music has deep meaning within the context of the narrative itself, in precisely the same way that the dialogue contributes to the narrative.

Or in other words, it is a hint book to the extremely detailed and rich back story and lore behind the entire concept which makes CONSORTIUM unique. Or in other-other words, it makes for an excellent alternative to playing the extremely complicated (and sometimes tedious!) A.R.G. Essentially, if you play through CONSORTIUM and find yourself wanting more story, more lore, more world and character building, look no further than this document package. The whole package was written by Vidal Desertch, principal inventor of the iDGi-1 satellite, and takes an unbiased look at the early stages of the long-standing conflict between the Consortium King and the Guardian Church. These events are during the King’s early development, back in 2028, whereas the events of  CONSORTIUM are 14 years later. The core 140 page iDGi-1 Discoveries document is split into two sections; Part One covers the high level history and overlaying background information on the King, the Guardian Church, and everything else A.R.G. related. A good starting point. Part Two is the direct guide to the A.R.G. itself with walkthroughs for all the puzzles, screenshots, links to videos, and fully detailed information on every story development. Included in the package is every important image, video, or sound clip linked to from the core document and the A.R.G. itself.",""

The game centers on an old, worn down restaurant in the SherriSoda Tower, which was once the heart of the building but closed down as business (and tenants) dropped to an all time low. But with the local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum, SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve, Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring it back to its old five star status of world class dining. To do that, you’ll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of restaurant equipment and more. Nearly everything is unlocked from the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant, and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills? And if that weren’t enough, you’ll also have the opportunity to be cast in the Iron Cook television show, throw parties for offices in SherriSoda Tower, read virtual mail in your SherriSoda Tower Email account which ranges from game tips to crazy spam (nearly 500 emails in all), from customers providing feedback to your restaurant to opportunities such as being able to fund projects via “ClicknStart” and other big surprises! With hours of content and tons of secrets and unlockables, Cook, Serve, Delicious will provide a big challenge for anyone who’s ready to take their crumbling, rat infested eatery to a luxurious Platinum Star Restaurant. Good luck!

There is also a turn-based strategic campaign mode which ties the tactical fights together, featuring persistent terrains that will accumulate the battle scars, debris, and bunker ruins through your entire campaign. Choose from several unique technology factions, each featuring their own sets of expendable soldier bodies, mechas, weapons, tools, and landing craft. Protect your brain, mine the gold, and destroy the enemy cortex in his bunker complex! Key Features: Fully destructible environments - The gold you need to excavate is sprinkled throughout the terrain of each scene. Use special digging tools to blast your way into the dirt and debris. All the pieces of bodies and ships from your struggles will fall to the ground and permanently add to the battlefield. Get more powerful (and expensive) diggers and you can even tunnel into your enemies' bunkers from below! Strategic metagame campaign – The intense, real-time tactical battles are put in a greater strategic context in the Campaign mode, thus giving each battle meaning and consequence. The gold-rich terrains on the planet and the defensive bunkers you build to defend them are persistent from fight to fight. This means there will be layers of debris, bunker ruins, tunnels, and corpses piled up in layers, telling the history of each place throughout each campaign played. In-game buying menu - At any time and place during the game, bring up a powerful menu to order new bodies and equipment, all delivered at the location and by the transport ship of your choosing. Rockets are cheaper but unreliable and harder to land. Drop ships are far more expensive but can quickly deploy entire groups of puppets onto difficult terrain. Ships and equipment returned to the TradeStar are refunded to your account. Build your own bunker - At the start of most missions, you are able to take your time and build your own command bunker from scratch. Easily design twisting tunnels and place doors, traps, and turrets to thwart your enemies' intrusions! Pre-deploy and equip bodies in and around your installation to prepare yourself for your objectives. Don't spend too much though, or you won't have enough funds left when the mission starts! Four-player cooperative and/or versus multiplayer - Gather your friends and plug in those game controllers! Play skirmish or campaign missions with or against up to three of your buddies. 2 vs 2, 1 vs. 3, 4 vs. the CPU - it's up to you! (rhyme intended). Flexible control settings allow you to use the keyboard, keyboard + mouse, or any generic game controller you can find and plug in. Built-in editors and modding - Several in-game editors allow you to easily create your own stuff. The game's engine is built to make it very simple to modify and add your own content.

Storyline Thirty years ago in the mid-2040s the sweeping development of neuroscience stirred up the common anticipation of victory over aging and death. In 2047 the scientists of the Neurocopying Institute in Cologne run the first experiments on transferring human consciousness onto an artificial carrier. In the course of experiments a weird previously unregistered phenomenon was discovered - the copies of neurotic system of the test subjects awoken in the computational device began to self-destroy by immersing in a state of deep irrational fear. The discovery of the mysterious phenomenon induced a string of events to have completely changed the society. Dozens of years later the question of the ‘Panic Attack’ nature still remains open. We do not know how far the researchers’ thought has led them in search of the answer, but we believe it hardly ever visited this Mongolian steppe. Year 2076, Mongolia. You wake up in a yurt amidst the boundless steppes. You neither remember your name, nor are aware of how long you had slept. Who are you? Who is this mechanical girl sitting on the table and what is the number she has on her chest? Nearby there towers the dome of a neglected entertainment park. How did it appear in these desert lands? What has happened here? Look around and try to sort things out. You are to begin on a peculiar and a touching story.","$12.99"

Explore a random generated world populated by dangerous creatures, build a dwarf fortress, gather resources, and craft all the items, weapons, and armor you need. GOD-SIMULATION You control a tribe of dwarves by giving them commands to dig in certain places, attack enemy creatures, and build houses and other structures. You'll need to provide your dwarves food and clothing, as well as help them with magic when fighting against other inhabitants of the world. You start the game with one dwarf and gain additional dwarves as your experience level increases. SANDBOX GAME Each game level has many layers of earth to explore, from the sky down to boiling subterranean lava. The level is randomly generated as an island, restricted by natural boundaries: oceans on the edges, lava beneath it, and the sky above. Other features include day and night and changing weather conditions. The worlds differ in size, humidity, temperature, terrain, and flora and fauna. Abandoned halls and rooms with treasure are hidden somewhere deep within the islands. CRAFTING One feature of the game is a user-friendly system of recipes for crafting. The recipes are organized and easily accessible. You can craft dozens of different items: building blocks for houses, furniture, decorations, weapons, armor, ammunition, and food for your dwarves. RTS At the outset you find the recipes for basic tools and items, and build a small house with places to sleep and eat. Then, the size of the tribe increases and catches the attention of other inhabitants of the world. Most of them are night creatures and dwell underground. The worlds are full of fantasy creatures like zombies, skeletons, goblins, beholders, ghosts, giant spiders, and others. Some of them pay little attention to the dwarves, as long as the dwarves do not come into their field of vision. Others gather into quite large groups and try to break into the dwarves’ residence. TOWER DEFENSE Especially dangerous are the waves of monsters that appear from time to time from portals. So, do not neglect to build a safe haven with strong walls and numerous trapdoors, cells, firing towers, and secret passageways. MAGIC As a divine being, you possess various spells. You can speed up the movement of the dwarves, open small portals, illuminate dark caves to scare away monsters, evoke natural magic in the form of rain or tree growth, hurl fireballs at the monsters’ heads, and find useful resources and hidden rooms underground, thereby helping to speed up resource extraction, exploration of the world, and the population growth of your assistants.","$18.99"

His followers are well versed in every extortion, infiltration and martial art. Pony and Biki are his best students, his pride and joy. The duo knows the secret chakra technique like the back of their hand (or hoof in Pony's case). Together they rule the city and its surroundings. Although everyone respects and fears them they are hunted by law enforcement agencies. They are Ninjas. Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon (CPHD) is a brand-new Action/RPG game developed for SNK’s Neo Geo console which came out in 1990. It might look like a straight-forward arcade game, but under the surface is a persistent world with a rich and varied set of rules. In CPHD “Run’N Gun” mechanics from the likes Shock Troopers or Ninja commando are combined with playful “RPG” ones from games like Zelda or Secret of Mana. You'll need to explore every level to find the resources necessary for your progress: coins, health bonuses, resurrection potions, special Ninja techniques, etc. Treasure chests are hidden everywhere. You’ll have to find them to afford equipment upgrades from the ninja shops. In addition Pony and Biki gain experience points by defeating enemies, becoming more powerful over time. Be careful though: you’ll have to use your resources wisely. Health is limited so if you don't equip yourself at the armory you're in for a hard time. Money is limited too however: you'll need to choose these investments carefully! Make new friends: a local multiplayer co-op mode lets a second player drop in at any time. It’s even more fun, even more frantic and even more strategic! Lose old friends: there are the same numbers of resources no matter how many players there are; will you share or will you hog everything? Have a good adventure! Why create a game for Neo Geo? Several reasons pushed us to develop for this console. The Neo-Geo is a legend amongst consoles, and is the one we dreamed of throughout our childhood and teenage years. For this reason, when we decided to bring our main character “Ninja Pony” to life, we wanted his early adventures to take place in the Neo-Geo universe. Thus we are offering our beloved Pony this welcoming present: to be born into the world of this “Rolls Royce” of consoles. Having our character emerge on cartridge is a way of enshrining him in the Pantheon of video game heroes, alongside Sonic and Mario. It's a way of going back in time! It also made sense with regards to the character's back-story. Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon relates the teenage years of Ninja Pony. This parallels the advent of the Neo-Geo in the history of video games: this console personifies gaming's teenage years. Last but not least there were technical challenges we were eager to overcome. We realized that there were very few traces of the tools and documentation required to develop games on Neo-Geo. What's more this arcane knowledge was gradually disappearing! We had to become archaeologists, investigating, looking for clues, piecing together how these games were developed. We created our own software and hardware pipe-lines, started working directly in pixel art again, etc. We were able to leverage our experience working on “modern” video games in returning to blow the dust off these old techniques. It was an exciting job, a true act of video game craftsmanship! Why bring the game to PC? When we announced the Neo Geo version many expressed regret at not being able to play the game. Since our main ambition at Le Cortex is to offer original play experiences to as many people as possible we wanted to avoid restricting the release to Neo-Geo connoisseurs and collectors. So we decided to port the game to the gamers' platform of today: the PC. And in case you were wondering this is indeed a full native port, not the Neo-Geo ROM being run via an emulator! About Le Cortex Le Cortex is an independent French Studio located in Paris. We design, write and develop games which aim to offer brand new play experiences.","$9.99"

Weapons&Devices Minigun : [/b]High fire rate,high bullet speed,need turn your ship to aim. Energy Shield: Blocks high speed bullets,width 5,length 1,will turn red and lose function temporarily when get overtaken damage. Torpedo: Fly pass through Energy shield,only weapon to destroy deck under device. AA-Gun: Shoot down all slow bullets as torpedo and mortar ammo,high fire rate,low range,low damage. Armor: Protect the deck under it,can take several torpedo attacks,or use to collide with enemy's ship.Armor on a multiple level deck is very hard to destroy. Mortar: Low fire rate,low bullet speed,long range.Fly pass through Energy shield and armor,destroy target directly,destroy multiple targets nearby with high damage,suitable to attack heavy armor enemy,not suitable to flexible ships. Thrust: The bigger your ship is,the slower it will be,both in movement and steer,thrust increase ship's move and steer speed. Cannon: Low fire rate,high bullet speed,push enemy ships back when hit,use it to push enemy back or push them to hill and crash into pieces.

Weapon balance Energy Shield block high speed bullet Missile pass through Energy Shield AA-Gun shoot down Missile Torpedo break Deck Armor withstood Torpedo Mortar fly over Armor Strategy Balance High fire rate weapons strategy defeats Flexible movement strategy: High fire rate weapons can shoot flexible target accurately with high speed bullet. Tank strategy defeats High fire rate weapons strategy:  Energy shield and armor can block bullets effectively. Low fire rate weapons strategy defeats Tank strategy: Take advantage of slow movement and heavy armor ships,use low speed but shield ignore missiles to destroy their line of defense. Flexible movement strategy defeats Low fire rate weapons strategy: Use flexibility to dodge slow bullets and rush to the weak side of the enemy,shoot/collide and run. Points and Weight Balance The design points of ships are limited.Every strategy of points allocation has pros and cons: Weapons and devices need more points. Deck Cube need less,the cheap deck can be used to collide enemy ship hull,Higher deck give the weapons longer shoot range and protect devices behind it. But more decks make your ship heavier,penalize you in low move and steer speed.Some weapons are more effective in numbers,such as single mortar has low accuracy,but plenty of mortars shoot at same time make enemy hard to escape. So it's better to allocate points in several kinds of weapons than buy all kinds all devices.Besides,combined weapon is mush more powerful than scattered ones. Critical Skill The top most 3 kinds of devices can use Critical Skill in game  by clicking the Critical Skill button.More devices need more cool down time,which are more powerful as well.After you release the critical skill,the weapons will keep in critical model for a short time.Every device has special critical skill.Some weapon increase attack point,some weapon increase fire rate,the thrust increase force,Energy shield refill its energy and increase energy regenerate rate,Armor refill health point and increase defense rate. Use critical skill at right time is the key to win a battle,some critical skill can be used together,such as use critical thrust to rush to enemy then use critical armor to collide it.Use both critical thrust and critical cannon to fall back and push the following enemy away.

Damned explores the sense of being defenseless against a powerful supernatural force. The survivors can’t directly affect the monster in any way. When it’s there to get you, your only chance is to run and hide. This perception of being defenseless is very strong, primal and terrifying, it builds up anxiety and makes you really scared, fearing any unexplained noise or movement. This is how Damned creates horror in a multiplayer game session, and we believe it to be super effective! (tested and approved!) - Why is Damned a randomized game? Every stage in Damned is randomized: Almost all the objects in a stage may or may not appear; The item system is fully random too, randomizing which item will appear in the game, and where it'll be; The way to win a match as a survivor is also randomized; Even the stage may trigger random events to scare the survivors inside. - Why is Damned a competitive and cooperative game? Because in a full game, with 4 survivors and 1 monster, there’ll be a survivor “team” cooperating to try and escape together, and at the same time they’ll be competing against a monster, trying to flee from him and deny each one of its attempt to hunt and kill a survivor. - How to play as a survivor? As a survivor you’ll be cooperating with your friends (up to 4 survivors in a single game session): You and your friends will be searching the level for keys and items to help in your escape; Each survivor will have a flashlight that can be turned on and off, helping you see your surroundings, but at the same time letting the monster know where you are; The survivors will be able to manipulate objects throughout the hotel, like drawers, doors, safes, cabinets, wardrobes; Challenge yourself to find the exit and get out alive. - How to play as the monster? As the monster, your game will be all about competing alone against the survivors team. The game will feature different monsters, each one unique in its play style. It's up to you to play a few rounds with each monster and decide which one works best for you. How are you going to hunt and kill the survivors? - Why is Damned worth buying? Because it’s fun! It’s really scary, you’ll find yourself on the edge a lot of times, trying to evade the monster or trying to pay closer attention because you don’t know if the sound you just heard is some random noise or if it is the monster haunting you. It’s a real horror game, it explores deeply the feeling of being completely defenseless against a powerful force that can finish you easily. Your only choice is to run and hide! And also because it’s really fun to play as the monster as well. You’ll keep haunting and building up anxiety in people, making them terribly scared of you. We really put you in the skin of a terrifying monster. - Links and contact: Got any questions and/or suggestions?

Besides the addictive core mechanics of placing towers to stop advancing enemy units, DoA also allows players to take on the role of the attackers seeking to conquer the enemy base.  DoA’s innovative new game concepts include light RTS elements, taking the popular genre to the next level. Players must oversee unit production and upgrades while assembling the most effective army from one of three playable races, each with unique locations, towers, and units. However, without magic, a fantasy game is little more than a toothless lion (or dragon, rather), so a wide range of spells will be available for players to decimate their enemies and protect their forces.  Although DoA includes a single-player portion, the focus of the game is undoubtedly multiplayer, where two to four players can take each other on or compete against AI opponents via Internet, LAN, or PSN.

To fill the void, Demigods from across from the mortal world must wage war against one another in a bid to ascend to true godhood. Set in a magical world where gods walk among mortals, Demigod blends action, strategy and role-playing elements into a thrilling new experience. Select the Demigod that will lead your minions into battle and unleash the dogs of war against your rivals. Your Demigod will do whatever it takes in order to ascend to true godhood. Once in the Arena, each Demigod will be joined by support troops that fight to the death as you struggle to seize key control points and slowly turn the tide of war in your favor. And your Demigod will level up during the course of each battle, becoming even more powerful as you unlock new abilities and powers. It's a brutal conflict of Demigod versus Demigod, where the very ground beneath their feet will tremble and quake. Demigod is a real-time, tactical strategy game that includes extensive role-playing elements. Choose from several Demigods, each poised for battle with their own unique capabilities and awe-inspiring powers. Vanquish other would-be gods as you gain levels, increase in power, unlock the power of mystic artifacts and slowly battle your way closer to joining the Pantheon. Key features: Revolutionary strategy/action game that combines tactical prowess with role-playing depth. Your Demigod is the focus of your power in the arena. Each of the 8 included Demigods has unique powers and abilities. Like a role-playing game, players can purchase equipment for their Demigod, add new powers to their Demigod as it gains experience, acquire artifacts that remain persistent between games. Each Demigod plays differently enough that it provides a diverse gaming experience. Like a strategy game, players have strategic objectives in each arena that, when captured, provide resources that give access to better units and some Demigods have the ability to summon their own minions that they can individually control. There are gold mines that can be captured to give more resources, artifact shops that, if captured, make their resources available to your team. Battle in a persistent online world in multiplayer or play single player either in a skirmish or in the virtual tournament. The on-line pantheon allows players to ""skirmish"" against other players of similar skill or take part in the on-line Pantheon tournament where players choose the path of light or darkness and earn favor points to help their faction win the tournament. Players can also play on the LAN or play custom games with friends on the Internet. Players earn favor points through victory with different awards given for different achievements during the game. These favor points can be used to purchase special items that exist from game to game. Increase your Demigod's powers and abilities by leveling up during each battle. In each game, your Demigod will start at level 1. As you kill enemy grunts and Demigods and capture flags, you gain experience which will cause your Demigod to gain experience levels. When a new experience level is gained, the player can add new skills and abilities to their Demigod to make him or her more powerful. Wage massive, earth-shattering battles across a series of awe-inspiring Arenas. Demigod makes use of the same awesome technology as Supreme Commander. However, it has been greatly enhanced with Gas Powered Games' new ""mesh"" technology that allows the game to have incredible visuals even on older video cards. The arenas in Demigod are not your typical ""maps"". Instead, they have each been crafted as a full blown 3D model unto itself in which players battle on the surface of them. Seize key, strategic positions on the map and turn the tide against your enemy. Push deep into their base and destroy them once and for all. Key resources in an arena are controlled by capturing the flag associated to that resource. When a player controls that resource, the entire team benefits. Controlling flags also generates war points which are added to your team's war score. When enough war points are collected, new upgrades in the team's Citadel become available for purchase. ","$9.99"

The game simulates the motivations, loyalties and desires of everyone in the country. As president or prime minister, it's your job to balance the need for income from taxes against the demands of the voters. Do you want your country to be an eco-friendly green paradise? Or a capitalist utopia? Will you pander to the patriots, the liberals or the religious pressure groups? Can you keep crime under control without destroying the civil liberties of your citizens? And can you keep good diplomatic relations with other nation states?  Despite the complex simulation underneath, Democracy 2 is easy to pick up. An innovative user-interface shows the relationships between everything in the game just by hovering your mouse over an object. The game is 'turn based', so it's the ideal game for those who prefer an intelligent, thoughtful game.  The key to the game are the policy 'sliders' that let you adjust how your government runs. You can raise or lower taxes with a slider, or even adjust education policy, or workers rights in exactly the same way. This system makes for a game that is easy to learn and difficult to master.  Democracy 2 covers the whole range of political opinion and policy, from debates over stem cell research and school prayer, through the provision of state health care and benefit payments to the unemployed, right across to tax shelters for the wealthy, the death penalty, military spending and civil rights. Regardless of where you stand on political topics, you will have the option to take control of the government and put your ideology to the test.","$19.99"

Complex simulated voters Each individual voter is a mixture of a subset of the 21 different voter groups represented within the game. They might be a young, wealthy, liberal socialist commuter, or a retired conservative religious capitalist, for example. Not only this, but the extent to which they identify each of those groups is both variable, and can be affected by your policies in the long term. Convert your country to religion, or atheism, to capitalism, or socialism by careful and nuanced adjustment of your policies and laws over time.

Have you ever watched an episode of Scooby-Doo! and wished that, just once, those meddling kids didn’t get in the bad guy’s way? Well, then, you're in luck! Devil's Bluff is a highly social online murder-mystery where a group of friends are invited to the exclusive annual Halloween tradition of the Crawley Mansion, high atop the infamous Devil’s Bluff. Each year, guests are invited to take part in a costumed scavenger hunt on the expansive grounds of the reportedly haunted estate. The catch? There's a killer in your midst, and if you can't finish the Hunt, they've made a promise to finish all of you. Master the Mansion Explore the massive Crawley mansion, discovering secret rooms, doors, and passageways filled with interactive objects like trap doors, deadly spikes, teleportation devices, and clever hiding places. Be the Hunter or the Hunted Each game, one player will be randomly chosen to be the Devil, a killer in disguise as one of the dinner guests. Only the killer can attack, so players must push to finish the scavenger hunt before they are eliminated. Fun With Backstabbing  Devil's Bluff is all about betrayal, backstabbing, and occasionally b****-slapping a rival to gain the upper hand. You can cooperate to distract, evade or capture the killer, but who can you trust? Form alliances, turn on each other, or go it alone - wit and wisdom are crucial to survival. Catch the Killer Players can team up to capture the Devil, but they have to uncover their identity first. Use audio chat to work together with nearby survivors to expose the secret identity of the killer, then team up to take down Devil and win the game. Communication is Key The game features proximity-based audio. Sound is only heard if players are close to the source, which means that every conversation, every footstep, and every random household sound can be a clue or the thing that leads the killer to your location. Terrifying Tunes The game's interactive 16-bit style soundtrack from Jake ""Virt"" Kaufman sets the tone for each area of the Mansion, with a special evil undertone that interrupts whenever the killer is close.

It distills the essence of the fighting game genre into just two buttons with no d-pad directional movement. Divekick’s focused gameplay demonstrates how much depth a single move actually has, and introduces (or reinforces) skills fundamental to the genre: mind games, spacing, timing, and quick reactions. At Iron Galaxy we love fighting games. To the average fan, most of what makes them fun is hidden behind a never-ending series of input combinations that they have to memorize. That’s why Divekick has just two buttons: Dive (into the air) makes your character jump straight up. Kick causes your character to fly foot first at a downward angle. If you press Kick on the ground, you can jump away from your opponent. Utilizing these moves, the first hit will win the round, and the player that wins five rounds first wins the game. It’s pure adrenaline, awareness, and outsmarting your enemy. It’s a fighting game deconstructed into its purest form. Key Features 14+ Completely unique and original characters, each with their own fighting style and special techniques. Includes two extra playable characters: Fencer from Nidhogg and Johnny Gat from Saints Row! A story for every character in the game, including an intro, ending, and rival battles.

Explore You are a drone operator, surrounded by old gritty tech that acts as your only eyes and ears to the outside world. What you hear comes through a remote microphone. What you see is how each drone sees the world. Motion sensors tell you something's out there, but not what. And when you issue commands, you do it through a command line interface. Adapt You have to earn everything in Duskers, scavenging drone upgrades, drones, and even ship upgrades. But dangerous creatures lurk in these derelict ships, and weapons are rare, so you may need to think of a clever way to explore a military outpost using only a motion sensor and a lure. But even if you find a way, the sensor that you rely on may  break down, or you may run out of lures, even your drone's camera feed can start to fail.  A favorite strategy can't be exploited for long, so you'll have to continually adapt. Survive Duskers is set in a procedurally generated Universe, and when you die you lose everything. You not only need to worry about what hazards lay waiting for you in the derelicts, but also running out of fuel, or parts to modify your drones and ship. You are alone, isolated in the dark reaches of space. Only by sifting through what ship logs remain un-corrupted can you piece together what happened.

EARTH 2150: ESCAPE FROM THE BLUE PLANET The 21st century was supposed to herald the dawn of a new age. The wars, famines and suffering of the last 20 millennia were to become a distant, fading memory, as scientific advances brought global peace and prosperity. Toward the end of the 20th century, a now forgotten US president even went so far as to officially proclaim the arrival of a New World Order, in which right, not might, would govern international relations. This bright future was not to be. First came a meltdown of the international stock and currency exchanges. Then the major international conglomerates were dissolved in a vain attempt to stop the fiscal hemorrhage. By 2012 the world economy had collapsed. Poverty and hunger caused social and political tensions to flare. As the crisis wore on, few were bold or naive enough to predict anything positive for the future. Most realized that the planet was on the verge of global conflict. In 2048, the anticipated global conflict broke out with a violence that shook the planet to its core. All major centralized governments were destroyed in the maelstrom. Europe and Eastern Asia bore the brunt of the devastation, as entire urban centres, from Madrid to Moscow and from Seoul to Singapore were literally wiped off the map. The human race has always been known for its resiliency. Within a dozen years, the Earth's inhabitants had begun to restore their old nationalities - with a few twists. Twelve states of the former United States joined together to form a new country, called the United Civilized States. The UCS citizens had essentially given up their old roles as producers and leaders. Nearly all work was being performed by robots which are controlled by expert computer systems. Not surprisingly, the human inhabitants of the UCS had become lazy and decadent. The 20th-century dream for a better world had ended in death and destruction. EARTH 2150: THE MOON PROJECT The year 2150 … one of the blackest chapters in the history of mankind. While the Lunar Corporation, Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States are preparing themselves for the last all-encompassing battle, work is being feverishly carried out on a secret project on the Moon. Only the code name of this project is known ………… ""SUNLIGHT"" EARTH 2150: LOST SOULS It is the 7th of December 2150 – in a few hours our beloved planet Earth will no longer exist. Devastating wars between the Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States have wreaked havoc and caused mortal wounds to our planet, but that is not all, a series of nuclear explosions close to the Antarctic had changed the Earth’s orbit around the sun, glaciers melted, the sea rose to a threatening level, and meteorite showers buried whole parts of the world. Famous scientists from the Lunar corporation, a long forgotten colony on the moon first recognized the signs of the imminent catastrophe. According to their calculations  the distance between the sun and earth would decrease in the next few years by 17%, which would lead to terrible consequences. The only hope left for the population was the escape to the red planet Mars. Hurry up, cause time is ticking away....","$6.99"

EHM offers fans the most realistic, in-depth and immersive simulation of hockey management available, giving them the chance to manage either club or country in any of the world’s top hockey-playing nations. EHM allows you to take full control of your roster – you decide who to sign, who to trade and who to draft. You assemble the perfect coaching team and then, with everything in place, you can choose to either employ a head coach to guide your team from behind the bench, or take control of the coaching duties yourself. Whichever you choose, you can follow the action ‘live’ or watch the game highlights afterwards through the realistic ‘top down’ 2D game engine. To mark its move from Early Access to full availability, EHM now offers a number of new and updated features, including: a greater number of playable domestic leagues and cup competitions; Steam Workshop integration; additional screen resolutions and a multiplayer option which allows up to 30 players to compete against one another and many more improvements inspired by user feedback. Eastside Hockey Manager – Key Features Dynamic 2D Game Engine Follow the action in either your own games or those of your rivals through the advanced ‘top-down’, 2D game engine, which incorporates state-of-the-art physics modelling (including realistic deflections and shot-blocking) and convincing player AI. There’s even a zoom mode for those who want to get closer to the action. Realistic Contemporary Game World A detailed game world where players can manage and coach in more than 30 playable domestic leagues and cup competitions from across the globe, each of which features up-to-date rules and league structures. Multiplayer Action Up to 30 players can compete head to head in in the same online game world. Steam Workshop Integration EHM includes support for the inclusion of user-generated content (such as custom databases and graphics) through the easy-to-use Steam Workshop system. Complete Roster Management Full control over the building and management of your roster, including everything from offering contracts to scouting, drafting promising players and trading with other teams. Complete Personnel Management Full control over non-playing personnel, including the ability to sign coaches, scouts and physios. Total Tactical Control Coaches can get the best out of their roster by creating and managing detailed tactics that can be configured to an entire team, an individual unit or even a single player. Lifelike Trade Negotiations Managers can gauge interest to trade proposals from their opposite numbers as well as getting feedback from their own assistant. Each team has their own needs and some are ready to offload prospects for that key veteran that makes them a true contender whilst others might be looking to move high-earning veterans in order to rebuild through the draft. Intuitive User Interface The centralised navigation bar makes management easier and more intuitive with all key management controls incorporated into the main menu bar. Improved Player Progression Players develop and age naturally, with new players coming through the junior systems and older players eventually retiring or moving on into non-playing careers. Furthermore, the role-based attribute modelling makes players more realistic and more varied. International Management EHM includes the opportunity to manage international teams (including U20s) in all of the key tournaments – and many less high-profile competitions too. Database Import The database format allows the importing of user-generated up-to-date rosters and even historical starting databases (created for earlier versions of EHM). And Much, Much More… …including detailed financial modelling of player contracts, salary caps and player budgets; a nation overview screen which allows you to view all of the top leagues, clubs and players for each country; player/non-player profiles; an option to start the game with a fantasy draft; all-star games with skills competitions and many, many other features.","$19.99"

It will test your reactions and concentration levels to the max! Fight your way through wave after wave of neon coloured space enemies, leveling up your score multiplayer and shields as you go. The onslaught just keeps on building with new challenges the further you progress. You'll need to be super focused if you want a place on the global high score table, one blink and it can be all over! Echoes+ is a showcase game made using App Game Kit 2 (AGK). You can learn more about App Game Kit 2 here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/325180/ Echoes mode Echoes mode consists of 10 levels of blasting action, each introducing a new enemy with different strengths & weaknesses. When you get hit you lose energy but it can be replenished by collecting green power ups. Getting hit may also downgrade your weapon, but act fast and you can power it back up again. Increased kills means more power-ups. Time Attack Just want a quick blast? Then try time attack. In this mode you have to score as many points as you can in 3 minutes.  You get unlimited energy but being hit incurs a points penalty. Tips The secret to a high score is collecting multipliers. The more enemies you kill the more multiplier power-ups will be dropped. Shooting stars will always drop a score multiplier. Warning! Points lost if hit are linked to the score multiplier. Survivor Mode This is all about how long you can survive without taking a hit. The score is irrelevant! Tips Your weapon will power up over time automatically. Time is your priority so shooting enemies might not always be the best approach. Destroying planets might be risky but they drop shields which will protect you for 10 seconds, invaluable in this game mode. Classic Mode This has a simpler game play and modified controls making it more like the 80's retro games. Tips Use smaller and more controlled movements than in other game modes. Try and stay away from the edge of the play area whenever possible. Listen out for the warning sounds that mean a saucer is approaching. Meteor Storm Mode This challenges you to fend off increasingly frequent and dense waves of meteors. Destroy the golden meteors & collect score multipliers. Tips Your ship starts with a fixed amount of energy which cannot be replenished. Getting hit reduces your energy but also causes you to drop some of your score multipliers. Your weapon power is fixed and cannot be increased. Asteroid Belt Mode Here you face snakes of energy that increase in both quantity and length at each new level. Tips Your ship starts with a fixed amount of energy which cannot be replenished. The score multiplier is linked to the number of asteroid belts at the start of the current level. Your weapon power is fixed and cannot be increased. Zoo Trials (zoots) These are a series of additional challenges. Each zoot can be attempted on any of the four difficulty levels, with harder difficulties contributing more towards your total completion percentage; Easy = 1%, Normal = 2%, Hard = 3% and Insane = 4% Only the hardest difficulty achieved counts towards your total, so for the ultimate 100% score you need to complete each of the 25 zoots on insane difficulty. Zoots can only be completed in specific game modes so make sure you check these on the zoo trials menu screen. The Pause screen shows your progress towards and zoots.

Fight for your life and deploy a range of weapons against fierce and obscure alien creatures. Mining and Resource Gathering: For building and construction, you need to gather and mine resources. Dig down to the rich deposits of a planet or drill through an asteroid full of rare ore. You might also plunder alien buildings or scrap any structure you come across.

RTS mode As the CEO put in charge of taking over the planet, it is your job to build large base complexes containing all the facilities you need, construct factories to produce robotic troops, research high technology to give you an edge over the competition and of course direct your army to annihilate the opposing company. Each facility is designed to snap easily together to create a seamless complex, which can then be upgraded with defence turrets, doors, forcefields and many other exciting technologies to help defend you from attack. As well as building your base, you will also need to control your armies to attack, defend and conquer new ground using high tech weaponry and cunning strategies to defeat your opponent. From nimble robots who are the backbone to your army, to heavy tanks and walkers to crush all who oppose you. Along side your troops you will have access to long range artillery and missiles to take out unsuspecting units from afar. Scattered across the map are various resources to help you improve and build your operation, from Thorium crystals to help boost power, to random meteorite impacts to give you rare resources for constructing the most powerful of units. FPS Mode Have you ever played your favourite RTS game and wished you were down there with your troops? In Executive Assault you can be! Take control of any of your units from down on the ground as a robot or tank, or take to the skies and bomb from your fighter jets or huge shielded hover cruisers, it’s completely up to you! Unlike most RTS games with FPS elements, in Executive Assault you will be able to enter the buildings that have been constructed and fight from inside, adding a whole new dimension to the RTS genre. Be down there in your robot factory defending it from the oncoming hordes, or assault the opposing power station by breaking in and sabotaging their power grid. Each unit in Executive Assault can be designed and customised to meet the needs of the battle. So if you find you’re being attacked by heavy walkers, then counter with heavy beam lasers to slice them down to size. Or if you find hordes of little bots are your problem, then upgrade your turrets with machine guns to rip them to shreds. In Executive Assault the decision is yours. Features Command armies and build bases from above. Take control of tanks, robots and aircraft to fully immerse yourself in the combat. Multiplayer, as there’s nothing more satisfying than blowing up your friends with cruise missiles. Co-op multiplayer game play where you can build a base in RTS and your friends can play as your robots in a pure FPS mode. Design and construct bases which you can then walk and fight inside. Control doors, turrets, alarms and forcefields to defend against attack. An extensive technology tree featuring over 140 technologies ranging from lasers to Quantum Gateways.

The sigils are symbolic representations of the magician's desired outcome. They are symbols created to cut through the walls of the conscious thought and affect directly the unconscious mind. It's at some extent, similar to subliminal messages. One of the techniques we use to create sigils is a Sigilization method created by Austin Osman Spare, who was a magician, as well as a painter and graphical artist. The technique consists in writing spells with your intents, and agglutinate the letters to reduce the written statements in abstract symbols. The conscious mind may not remember the meaning of the symbols, but the subconscious keeps the memories about the symbol being made. This way, the symbols and their intents charge each other, exponentially increasing their influence on the mind. ","$4.99"

FaceRig has three versions: FaceRig Classic is the base version of FaceRig, which allows for home non-profit use and even limited monetization on YouTube/Twitch or similar as long as the commercial aspect of it is not significant. We consider commercially significant using it on any avenue (channel) that produces you more than $500 monthly revenue. This includes ad-based revenue and voluntary donations (one time or recurrent such as a Patreon). If you are under this threshold you can use Classic, if you are above you need to upgrade to Pro or Studio. the FaceRig Pro DLC, which allows you to monetize videos on YouTube/Twitch regardless of the monthly revenue, but not for content exclusive to paid/subscription based services, such as the new YouTube Red (for content that is exclusive to YouTube Red or similar you will need FaceRig Studio). FaceRig Pro does not bring new assets, technical features or improvements to FaceRig Classic. For more details, take a look at the Pro DLC description the Studio Version allows commercial use, as well as  access to the expression mo-cap data. For more details about this version visit http://facerig.com We believe that FaceRig will entertain many gamers, modelling and animation artists, members of various fandoms, streamers, web casters, YouTubers and their audiences. For now we're focusing on just tracking and rendering the portrait with its expressions, but we aim to do more in the future. The FaceRig end goal is to provide a full featured real time digital actor set for home use. Key Features: Real time head and expression tracking in an input video stream, (also with audio analysis). Combining tracked data with additional virtual puppeteering input. On-the-fly animation re-targeting for the tracked data and applying the animation on a user selected 3d model, with audio processing (voice alteration) Rendering and lighting the animated model in real time, in a user selected background. Encoding the rendered video and sending it further as output from a virtual webcam (it basically intercepts webcam input, and swaps the images captured by your real webcam with the fantastic content before sending it further). Provide the interface for tuning the parameters of all operations above. Customizable avatars. To see the complete list on FaceRig avatars including the ones from DLC's please see: https://facerig.com/tips/tuesday-tips-0-avatar-list/ Open creation platform: you can make your own models (outside of FaceRig), import and use them as your avatars. The models need to be created according to  a set of published specs. Notes: Numeric export of the tracked expression data (exporting the motion capture data to use in other applications) is a feature reserved for the Studio version. FaceRig  Classic and Pro only output already rendered video and audio. FaceRig is an indie initiative, and its development so far has been successfully crowd-funded through Indiegogo. A warm thank you goes to our amazing backers for their support and enthusiasm. You can find the EULA here: http://store.steampowered.com/eula/274920_eula_1 ","$14.99"

On its way to an island marked on the map, his plane crashes, but the brave traveler survives. He wakes up to find himself in a giant maze that he must escape from to reach the treasure.  ★ GAMEPLAY ★  Your task will be to help the nice and unlucky character find a way out of this difficult situation by guiding him through the maze and, hopefully, taking him to the treasure chest. To do that, you will need all your concentration, logic, memory and patience. It’s a long and treacherous journey through a labyrinth where you will need to find keys to exit doors. You will encounter all kinds of obstacles, such as stones, plants, rivers, portals, crates and much more. You will also need to find many items that will help you overcome these obstacles. Each labyrinth is a unique exciting puzzle where you can easily get lost. However, if you find yourself in a dead end with no way out, you can always restart the game and try again. Sometimes even the weather will be a problem, making it hard for Mr. Fatty Maze to navigate through the maze in mist, during a blizzard, storm or night time. The game offers an exciting atmosphere, colorful graphics and animations, great music and sound effects, adventures in locations covered with jungle, ice and sand, over 50 types of levels, over 25 types of game items and obstacles and an amazingly beautiful and mysterious world! But the most important feature is the main character who changes depending on the maze conditions. You will be surprised to see how much better your memory and ability to solve logic puzzles will improve after beating the game! The game has no level time limitations, but the faster and more efficiently you beat a level, the more points you will get to compare your score with that of your friends. The game was created both for adults and their kids! The level editor to share after the game is released. Potential modification of the game is very high, with the level editor you can create amazing mazes and to share them with other players.  ★ FEATURES ★  • Colorful graphics and animations! • Great music and sound effects! • 3 missions: Jungle, ICE and Sand! • Over 50 types of levels! • Different play conditions: fog, sand storm or night time! • Many game items: hammer, machete, boat, sticks, clew, amanitas and much more! • Interactive obstacles: stones, plants, rivers, portals, bridges, crates, wild animals and much more! • Very-difficult to solve final labyrinths!  ★ SOCIAL NETWORKS ★  Become a part of the game’s community!

The campaign offers levels increasing in difficulty and size of the playing field while staying true to the core mechanics. It offers newcomers and veterans a challenge without the game being unfair, item drops will help you progress, and a little mishap near the end doesn’t mean “Game Over” right away. Further, Fine Sweeper is now integrated into Steam: There are 18 + 1 achievements waiting to be unlocked, global and local leaderboards, your progress and settings will be synced with the Steam Cloud so you can keep progressing no matter where you are.

Foresight is an epic space-based RTS game that throws you, the player, into the thick of the battle as a commander. Lead huge fleets, armed with fighters and bombers across wormholes to fight it out with your enemy. Launch bombing missions, fighter patrols, plant observation posts or fire support base with reconnaissance units. Intelligence is key. Recruit capable commanders as your fleet commanders; they'll not just obey your orders, they'll also talk to you, give you suggestions, raise requests and report on their progress. Fleets are semi-autonomous and therefore have their own command, which is separate from yours though they're under your command. This allows you to expand your forces beyond what you can control. They also progress alongside you, gaining experience and improving their abilities. As they get promoted in rank, so does your command; allow you to control more ships. Foresight redefines the strategy component of RTS games by rewarding players for executing correct strategic decisions and not punishing players for a single mis-click or being less dexterous. Build order complexity is minimized to allow players to focus on what matters; building the right thing. Need to arm a capital ship with fighters and bombers? No problem - simply make a request with that ship. Foresight's AI will automate the entire process - between picking the nearest shipyard with the lowest load and deployment to the designated ship. So, what's your battle plan? Blitzkrieg? Flank attack? Even in space, such plans are possible because Foresight is built to deliver an reasonably accurate outcome. A large navy may not always win the day. Finally, enjoy the epic battle as fighters dogfight each other, bombers performing bombing runs and ships firing all weapons in their full glory! Features Foresight supports up to 8 players in single player battles or multiplayer skirmishes. Create fleets with officers who will then talk to you and offer suggestions. Form massive fleets quickly without a complicated build tree. Reasonable automation eliminates the need to overly micro-manage RTS ""chores"", now you can focus on the battle more. Tide of war can be tilted by intelligence gathering and positioning of ships, as well as having a healthy supply of fighters and bombers. The largest army may not always win. Every player is represented by an avatar character in game, making sneak attacks and assassinations worthwhile. Most of the 36 Strategems applicable and is highly replicable in Foresight Commanders and Advisors will level in their statistics gradually with action in combat and will unlock more innate abilities to aid you.

Create traps that poison or slow, discover powerful artifacts and unlock new abilities, and stand alone against The Forgotten, a seemingly unkillable archdemon whose endless armies threaten to swallow the world.

Not one, not two, but three Rufuses cause all kinds of crazy mayhem in the long-awaited adventure comedy Goodbye Deponia! The Organon plans the destruction of Deponia, the lovely Goal has (once again) disappeared, and anti-hero Rufus just can't seem to stop getting in his own way. All inventor and free spirit Rufus wanted to do was to get off the junkyard planet of Deponia and move to Elysium, the paradise orbiting Deponia as a spaceship reserved for the highest echelons of society. Goal, the ex-Elysian girl that Rufus has fallen head over heels for, still seems to be the key to his endeavor...and to the elevator that will get him to space. Finally, Rufus has come up with a seemingly perfect plan. And yet, everything that could possibly go wrong suddenly does go wrong. Rufus finds himself (initially in disguise) on a highway cruiser amongst stern-faced officials of the Organon, while Goal goes missing. When Rufus stumbles upon a cloning machine, he believes to have found his way out. A clone copy is supposed to help him out of his predicament. But an ""inexplicable"" error causes complications and Goal slips from our hero's reach once again. Now, he has to solve three major problems: He needs to find Goal again, reach Elysium and prevent the destruction of the entire planet of Deponia by the hand of the Organon. Three problems that only three Rufuses could solve – and thus, the luckless inventor decides to clone himself! This leads to crazy ramifications for the player: In Goodbye Deponia, the player occasionally needs to control all three Rufuses, using them to complete tasks together – despite Rufus stumbling over himself so often.

Gratuitous Space Battles cuts right to the chase of sci-fi strategy games, and deals with large, completely unjustified space battles between huge opposing space fleets. Gratuitous Space Battles combines the visual appeal of an RTS, with the addictive unit-placement and design gameplay from tower defense games. In GSB, the player does not control individual ships at all during battle. The ships fight to a pre-determined set of orders and formations given to them by you before the battles. GSB casts you as supreme space admiral, tasked with the design of individual spaceships, and the composition of your fleet, as well as general orders of engagement. This is not a twitch-based real time arcade game like many an RTS, but a game of careful thought, planning and big-picture strategy. Huge space battles can be won or lost depending on just how cleverly you balanced the needs of defensive shielding and armor against the expensive punch of laser cannons and plasma torpedoes. GSB also features an innovative multiplayer challenge system. You can upload your ultimate fleet to serve as the enemy to other players, and keep track of how many other players have won and lost against your challenge. That way, you will never run out of cunningly designed enemies to battle against!  4 different unlockable player races  Over 40 different ship hulls  Over 120 spaceship modules  Choice of skirmish vs AI, never-ending survival mode or play against other player’s fleets with the online challenge system  Play with different rules as each battle has different spatial anomalies to deal with.

Slip the surly bonds of earth and take to the skies as a bold Captain, fearless Gunner, or cunning Engineer. Raising the stakes on team-based PvP combat with an emphasis on strategic competition and team play, Guns of Icarus Online is all about teamwork, tactics, and fast-paced action. With a good ship and the right crew, you can conquer the skies! A vivid steampunk world  Lumbering, heavily-armored airships bristling with guns patrol the skies above a land ravaged beyond repair by an out-of-control industrial revolution. Build your own airship  Starting from a selection of basic hulls, players can mix and match hundreds of custom parts to create their own unique airship, then assemble a crew to fly it. Your ship is your life  Your ship is your collective life bar - when the ship goes down, the crew goes down with it. Every member of the crew plays an integral role in not only maintaining the integrity - “life” - of the ship, but also weakening the integrity of enemy ships as they work cooperatively towards a shared victory. The ultimate multiplayer team experience  You won’t be told to stay still and not die while a veteran preserves their Kill/Death ratio. In Guns of Icarus Online, you have to work together. It’s an entirely interdependent gameplay experience that cannot be won by a single crew member. Goggles, gears, and glory  A wide range of costumes and cosmetic options to show off your style are available in the in-game store. These items are cosmetic only - there is no pay-to-win in Guns of Icarus Online. Pit crew against crew Form a party with up to 4 friends and crew a ship together to battle against other teams in massive airship battles with up to 32 players in a match with multiple game modes including Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Crazy King, Skyball, and VIP. Rise in the ranks  Earn titles and cosmetic upgrades through your achievements. Balanced, competitive matches reward strategic, skillful play, not level grinding. The Industrial Revolution never ended. Raging out of control, the new machines consumed the world, staining the sky, scouring the land and poisoning the water. Humanity came the brink of extinction, all but destroyed by their own unrestrained ingenuity. A few pockets of civilization survived, sheltering in the crevices of the world, and it is time for a comeback. Divided by wide expanses of toxic wasteland, a handful of these remnants have developed airship technology. Cruising through the sky, safely away from the poisoned earth, trade and industry could finally begin anew. However, with resources so desperately limited, war was inevitable. We are Muse Games, an independent studio based out of New York City. Our debut game, Flight of the Icarus , was the seed that would later grow into our flagship title. After releasing the unique and eye-catching platform game CreaVures in 2011, we dedicated ourselves to re-engineering our debut title into a fully-featured cooperative online airship combat game. We released Guns of Icarus Online in October 2012, right in the midst of Hurricane Sandy. Despite that challenging start, the game earned a loyal audience and built up a healthy community, passing the million player mark in January 2016. Since then, we have remained committed to supporting and expanding the Guns of Icarus experience. What was originally intended to be an expansion that would introduce AI opponents and player-vs-environment gameplay grew into a new standalone game - Guns of Icarus Alliance , the ultimate and definitive Guns of Icarus experience - which released in March 2017.

Check out the Community Hub for Frequently Asked Questions and other cool stuff! A BRIEF BACKGROUND Influent is a Language Learning Game focusing primarily on vocabulary acquisition and pronunciation. It was initially developed in Japan at the University of Tsukuba's Entertainment Computing Laboratory under the Monbukagakusho Government Research Scholarship . After research funding ran out, further funding from a wildly successful Kickstarter Campaign allowed for the completion of the game. A research paper on the ideas surrounding the game and its applications was published by the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ), which can be viewed in its entirety here . Andrew Cross is infuriated! For three long years, he sat confined to his work, developing a device that he firmly believed to be a technological breakthrough in the way people would interact with the world around them. A device that could scan any object in the real world and then provide its name in any language! Duly dubbing his fancy new invention the ""SanjigenJiten,"" Andrew arranged an appointment to demonstrate the device's amazing capabilities at the world's largest technology corporation, Technoglobe International. But while on his visit, he fell for a girl he met in the lab, and while she stole his heart, someone else silently stepped in and stole his device! Now, Technoglobe has gone and swiftly marketed the SanjigenJiten as their own, even laying claim to the very name he had so cleverly concocted! But Andrew Cross has a plan. He's made an even better version of his SanjigenJiten and launched an online campaign, swearing to learn 300 words in a foreign language to raise awareness of Technoglobe's blatant theft and prove his device really works! But does the SanjigenJiten really work? Can Andrew actually pull it off?!","$9.99"

Finally came the great rain of fire, and death fell down on sinner and innocent alike, blood flooding the streets in place of water. The people, in their desperation, turned away from the Holy Mother Church and delved deep into pagan decadence or succumbed to the temptation of the Devil. You have been charged with the office of Inquisitor. It is up to you to investigate crimes against the one true faith and root out heresy--using any and all means necessary. As in all best computer RPGs--the most important choices are yours to make. Inquisitor is a unique blend of action-oriented combat with a deep and involving tale of betrayal, torture, madness, and infernal damnation. Put your wits to the test as you collect evidence against possible heretics and put them to trial once they have been charged. Use the might of the Inquisition to extract a confession from your subjects, but be warned, use your power wisely or you will face the consequences. If a gritty old-school open-ended isometric RPG is what you looking for, look no further. Inquisitor will provide you with hours of gameplay and a dark, involving story. Deluxe version bonuses: Book – The Inquisitor Novel (pdf) Book – Revelation of Ezekiel (pdf) Artbook (pdf) Two-hour soundtrack (38 songs) ","$9.99"

The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations. Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed. Simplified HUD and UI for a clean, immersive user experience focused on the action and environments. Highly immersive particle FX and audio to intensify the game experience. Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or ""tug of war"". Ambush --- A high value target (""HVT"") must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.","$29.98"

Interstellar Marines is inspired by movies such as Aliens, Starship Troopers and Saving Private Ryan; and games such as Half-Life, Deus Ex, System Shock 2, and Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. Interstellar Marines is all about evolving the FPS recipe with the inspirations we've assimilated since the birth of the genre. Our goal is an evolutionary leap forward driven by our compulsive interest in science fiction, role-playing, military realism, and respect for first person immersion. Interstellar Warfare Initiative It is the dawn of the 22nd century, a time of great hopes and expectations. The discovery of a new and inexhaustible well of power known as Zero Point Energy has revolutionized space travel. Man has escaped the confines of Mother Earth, and gone on to colonize the solar system. But far away from public awareness an ambitious military project has already taken Man beyond the final frontier, and into the regions of the stars. The powerful Interplanetary Treaty Organization, ITO, is secretly constructing the first human settlement in another star system. You are a special forces soldier training to join the Interstellar Marines, a  part of the secret Interstellar Warfare Initiative being established to protect humanity against potential threats from the confines of the unknown universe. It's time to evaluate the Interstellar Warfare Initiative and program evaluations are taking place at The Vault, ITO’s most advanced military facility on Earth enclosed deep beneath Groom Lake, Nevada. Supervised by SARA, ITO’s central neural network AI, SARA will program artificial weather and advanced combat training robots to test each warfare initiative to the limits. This is where the game begins ... 7 Singleplayer/Co-op Missions Play 5 co-op and single-player missions against unscripted AI with dynamic environment effects or two pivotal missions inside the Interstellar Marines universe, The NeuroGen Incident and Assault on Starcrown Aerospace. Play singleplayer or co-op with up to three friends in intense action with more co-op and singleplayer missions to come! Wargames (Sandbox Combat Arena) Unique sandbox combat arena in the making. Wargames is played across 9 distinct interconnected environment zones allowing 64 players to join in the scavenge for combat points, playing alone or in co-op. We have a special Wargames Steam Leaderboard which tracks Combat Points globally, monthly, and survivors of Wargames. 9 Unique Multiplayer Maps Across 3 Game Modes Take your friends out in Deadlock, Deathmatch, and Team Deathmatch on maps featuring dynamic environment effects such as time of day, rain, thunder and lightning, emergency lighting, fire alarms, moving platforms etc. Realistic Simulation With a physics-based dynamic character controller there are no floating hands, and you can even see your feet! The physically present combat helmet has a HUD projected onto the visor and is affected by dust, rain, fogging, and damage. Aim down the sight for the long shots and use the tactical laser to assist aim when hip firing, as there are no artificial crosshairs to break immersion. Use the intuitive crouch and cover system; spacebar (default) peeks over cover, and looking down leans you forward to see over ledges. You can also shoot out the lights and prowl in darkness, or use the tactical flashlight if you’re afraid of the dark.

Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive. Features Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No ""hero"" characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a ""game"", you are living and surviving in a simulated world. Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive , or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character’s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. Original game world. There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic. ","$29.99"

Experiment with different types of music to create different types of fights! We got rid of the bars, arrows, button icons, etc. that other music games rely on as action cues and replaced them with fully 3D animated characters. Instead of just seeing characters in the background moving to a preset script as eye candy while the actual gameplay takes place in an abstract 2D interface, you actually control and react to those 3D characters.  That means you actually get to focus your attention on what those characters are doing! As you play the game, you're creating your own fight sequence with your button presses. We also let you get rid of all the other interface parts (such as score) if you like, so that there are no distractions from the action. KickBeat features a full length single player campaign with beautifully hand drawn animations and a unique art style. Media Quotes “KickBeat succeeds as both a rhythm game and a fighting one” – JoyStiq “Combining slick combat with finely tuned rhythm-action fare, KickBeat was so frenetic it even managed to stir me from my early-morning half-awake sate.” – Pocket Gamer “The hand-drawn animation really stands out in this regard and I found myself getting absorbed by the hypnotic flow of the figures moving in and out of the combat area.” – Destructoid ","$9.99"

Fulfill your destiny and claim your rightful place on the throne of Britannia. Recruit fabled knights to your Round Table: send them to adventures or battles, let them gather knowledge and artifacts, see how they become the most powerful heroes of the realm. Build the majestic Camelot, but beware: there will be enemies, both mortal and otherworldly that will try to destroy you. Send your heroes and their followers to battle with legendary warriors and monsters and see how the folk of the faeries and the saints set against wizards and evil knights.  Real-time fantasy battles: spectacular fight scenarios on grandiose battlefields, featuring thousands of soldiers and powerful heroes such as Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad or Merlin. Battles rely on the strengths and weaknesses of the different arms with several tactical possibilities, the abilities of the units and the heroes, monsters and most of all, spells.  Turn-based Campaign Map: Britannia is represented as a fully three dimensional topographic map where heroes move freely, conquer provinces or find adventures. In the turn-based campaign the changing seasons have effect on the gameplay and the graphics of the Campaign Map.  Create your own legend! The saga of King Arthur is an epic tale about the conquest of Britannia through a story-based campaign. The Campaign is divided into chapters, like a chronicle, each with a unique tone and theme. The chapters all have objectives, long- and short-term goals that also fit together to draw a grandiose picture of an unfolding storyline. There are many possible events and outcomes that all influence the legend itself and determine the ending of the storyline.

King Arthur might become a Christian ruler or the Follower of the Old Faith; a rightful or a ruthless monarch. These choices unlock special contents, allies, heroes, units and developments.  RPG elements: Heroes lead the armies and learn skills, spells and abilities from an ability tree for experience points. Heroes can also use magic items or become liege lords, entrusted with the leadership of a province, which is the best way to have them indebted. Arranging their marriages with the nice damsels of Arthur’s court also raises their loyalty.  Adventures: adventuring is the essence of King Arthur’s world. Quests pop up on the Campaign Map regularly. In technical terms it is a short story where the chosen knight has to make important decisions. Some adventures end in battles on special battlemaps.

Unfortunately, priceless artifacts very rarely give themselves up easily. Apart from the plethora of traps lying in wait, there are also monsters on the prowl, protecting the ruins. Head for the innermost depths of the ruins while solving a variety of mysteries, fending off monsters, and disarming traps. Forging ahead will be no simple task – the further into the depths you reach, the more difficult the mysteries become. The guardians of LA-MULANA do not take their job lightly. LA-MULANA on Steam is the PC port version of the acclaimed remake for WiiWare. One of the first NIGORO games, LA-MULANA was originally created back in the creators’ “amateur” days and has been renown worldwide. This game was created based on “that old-time feeling.” The creators wished to play the sort of games that enthralled them back in the day, only with more volume. The operability and difficulty level are certainly not “new school”. However, this game is highly recommended to gamers seeking out that feeling of total immersion that allows you to go full-on head-to-head with a game not found in somewhat lighter terms. Coming up on it's ninth birthday, LA-MULANA continues to captivate, frustrate and annihilate new and old players alike.

Lashing a great sky chariot to four mighty birds, the lord of Persia ascended far above the earth. Before the king's ambition could be fully realized, an angel appeared to quell his flight. But as the celestial creature prepared to strike down the Persian king, the glowing spirit of a child materialized. “Stay your hand, angel! I am KayKhosro, this great king's yet-unborn son. If you destroy this man for his arrogance now, you destroy me! To rob him of his present would be to rob me of my future.” The angel paused, considered the spirit's words, and sent the zealous King's chariot crashing down to the realm of Earth from whence it came. “I am forbidden from severing your bloodline, and have returned your ancestor to his kingdom alive, but the burdens upon you are heavy, indeed.” The angel embraced the spirit child, imparting these words. “You will be born into an age of conflict, your ancestors beset upon each other with steel and cruelty, and your people will look to you for guidance. One day, evil will descend upon the borders of Persia, and you must be ready. Now, rest, child. Your time has yet to come...”","$19.99"

Captain an Orc, Dwarf or Human warship and sail the turbulent Abyssal Ocean to play online multiplayer, in free-for-all or fleet based matches. The goal is to: Plunder as much gold as possible while outwitting and outgunning all others and be the last ship sailing. Be ruthless! Sink other players ships, take their loot and collect their bounty! Be greedy! Maps are littered with floating treasure chests and ships loaded with gold. Be cunning! As the match progresses hungry sea monsters become more aggressive and encroach the safe waters ships can sail in. Ships sailing in 'Dead Waters' for too long end up as monster chow! Be unsinkable! At the end of a match ships can be upgraded and customized with captains, cannons, armor, mates and more! BOMBASTIC BROADSIDES! Cannons are the heart of combat in Maelstrom. Cannonballs are physics controlled, with a significant firing arc and hang time, meaning prediction and good aim are necessary to deal damage effectively. On the receiving end, players with good reactions and anticipation coupled with a nimble ship can dodge incoming fire. WARSHIPS WIN WITH WITS Enemy ships can be rammed, grappled and boarded! A clever captain at sea will become a wealthy captain on land.  Skillfully maneuver yourself through the swelling sea and prepare your ship for ramming.  The faster the ship is moving the more devastating the collision will be on impact! Looking for a friendlier approach? Hold both ships in place while crews fight it out. Grapples will be cut eventually, so boarding actions only last a short time. If one crew manages to kill all of the opposing crew, they will set fire to the enemy ship, sending it to the depths! ARMOR, AMMO AND POSITIONAL DAMAGE Each ship has armor on all four sides. The armor sections serve as additional defense toward damage to that side and must be destroyed before the ship's hull can be damaged. Maneuvering to keep your armor between you and your enemy is vital to staying afloat - and seeking the enemy's damaged sides will make you much more lethal in combat! Every cannon has access to three kinds of ammunition and can swap during combat to suit the situation. Ammo is unlimited. Iron shot blasts chunks out of ship armor and hull. Chain shot is used to shred enemy sails and cripple a ship’s speed. Grapeshot slaughters enemy crew and makes ships easier to board. LURKING THE DEEP Like the ocean they reside in, sea monsters are titanic forces of nature. They stalk unwary captains and can devour a ship whole. Like this Murkwater Thrasher. Each ship in Maelstrom is a character with a colorful history and unique weaponry as well as strengths and weaknesses such as speed, firepower, crew, and toughness. There are many unique ships available for players to unlock and explore. ASHBORNE, HUMAN FRIGATE  Ashborne has incredibly punishing broadsides and wields spell-infused incendiary ammo, unique to her, which ignites enemy ships! HUMANS The well designed ships of mankind's Phoenix Empire are the fastest afloat. Each ship is armed with a large number of the most modern cannons available, giving them unmatched range and broadside firepower. Great speed Powerful broadsides Great range ORCS The shark-driven ships of the orcs are incredibly maneuverable, and have a large number of forward-facing cannons making them deadly on the pursuit. The orcs themselves are ferocious fighters, unmatched in combat during boarding actions. Lethal boarding Great ramming Formidable agility DWARVES Dwarves disdain brittle wood and flimsy sail, instead forging steel armored steamships. Dwarven ships can withstand far more punishment than the ships of other races and are armed with massive giant cannons on all sides. Though not the most nimble, all Dwarf ships can switch gears and sail in reverse. Tough armor Omnidirectional cannons Ships can reverse No additional purchases are needed to enjoy the game to the fullest extent. In other words there are no loot boxes, microtransactions, or anything of the sort .  Future content will be added in optional DLC packs or released to the community free of charge. Our goal is to keep the game healthy and the community satisfied. We promise to get Maelstrom into your hands in a fully playable and fun state and to keep the game healthy; to provide transparency and insight into decisions made about Maelstrom at all levels both vast and granular.

A skilled sniper, veteran of many covert operations, he was ready to take on the less legal side of the ""business"". Working closely with his friend Max - one of the best hackers there are - he quickly earned his fame among other mercenaries and private agencies. Yet, he was cautious enough to avoid standing openly against any legal government. He was even taking semi-official jobs that were too dangerous or too politically risky for any government agenda. This was an easy life. Until now. Features: First Person Perspective dynamic adventure shooter powered by the advanced Argon 5 technology. Play the role of a famous mercenary through 5 large, different chapters (14 huge levels total): Iranian hidden nuclear materials' processing plant, Moscow Trade Center where the trouble begins, City Dockyard hit-and-flee mission, Baykonur Cosmodrome shootout, and Iraq terrorist cave search for a missing VIP. Game reflects John's sniper expertise. At the beginning of each chapter he is given 2 sniper rifles - a silenced Arctic Warfare as a primary weapon and additionally one specialised rifle that fits the chapter best, selected from a variety of choices. Additional rifles range from a very fast, semi automatic Saiga with sniper scope to a heavy and deadly Barrett .50. Game simulates bullet ballistics depending on gravity, wind and bullet initial velocity for more realistic experience. Using silencer on the Arctic Warfare or on John's personally modified P99 pistol may be useful at times, as the enemies fully depend on their eyes and ears - and they cannot chase what they don't see nor hear. Playing the game as a ""standard"" shooter using automatic rifles and pistols taken from dead enemies is of course possible as well - still using sniper tactics over longer distances is easier. Sophisticated enemy AI allows them to fight in groups, using different weapons and explosives, alarming and supporting each other, using terrain and objects in their tactics. Game is powered by advanced technology and renderer that produces beautiful images, full of light, beautiful atmospheric effects, realtime water, reflections, shadows and different, realistic surface materials complete with vivid, living environments with animated plant life, insects and birds. Convincing storyline and action objectives. The player is constantly in contact with his HQ, which feeds him with data and changes mission objectives as he goes. ","$4.99"

The Bloodline system uses a randomized genetic code for every hero. Their children can end up with the best (or worst!) gameplay-impacting traits of their parents. Permadeath - The heroes in MASSIVE CHALICE age over the course of the timeline and eventually pass away. This forces the player to engage in the beauty of permadeath and always juggle an imperfect party of heroes with which to do battle! Bloodline Relics - If a hero has fought valiantly enough when they inevitably pass away, their weapon has a chance to become a Bloodline Relic. This powerful Relic can be passed down to any character of the same house in order to carry on the legacy of the fallen hero! Long View Strategy - Because the war lasts 300 years, players need to take a long view of their strategy.

Merchants of Kaidan is a challenging trading game fused with lots of RPG elements. You start very humble, one cart, a purse of gold and silver coins is all that you have. Your task is to roam the world and search of opportunities to score some profit. Buy low, sell high -  a merchant's motto is easy to grasp. And yet the job is harder than it seems. A good merchant needs to know everything about the market, he is always on the lookout for a deal, always listening, always engaging and deepening his knowledge. He knows what forces influence the prices, what events affect them. A good merchant listens to rumours and gossips spread by travelers at inns and taverns; hoping for a clue, a hint where to go, where a good deal awaits. A good merchant surrounds himself with specialists smarter than him, people who help him maximize profits and minimize losses. He always expands his fleet of carts, he balances risks, calculates profitability. The conditions are constantly changing, and supply and demand for different goods with them. Maybe you'd like to pay a cheaper price for furs in the summer, and sell them for a hefty profit as the winter is coming and people need warmth. But is it worth carrying them for so many days, risking robbery, moths and taking precious space that you could use to transport something now and make a profit immediately? Or is it worth to buy illegal herb in the out of reach swamps where it cost's next to nothing, and risk smuggling it into the city where you can sell it for an amazing profit? But what if the city guards want to control you? Should you pay a bribe? How big? Maybe the best course of action is to  say that you have nothing and hope they don't find anything? These are the types of questions you will have to ask yourself constantly.  Merchants of Kaidan has 4 story lines each with many quests. Main quest that brings you closer to avenging your father's murder, and 3 side-quest lines. A total of over 100 quests each composed of multiple steps. A set of random events that influence your journeys. A storm on the sea, attack by dragons, highway robbery and many, many more. Three types of transport of your goods: by roads, by sea and by flight, each has its advantages and disadvantages and a unique set of events associated. As you grow your fleet you can join a partnership and you'll get to manage 3 traders. You can hire advisers each specializing in a different field. Their council will help you in a variety of issues. Some will show you shortcuts on the roads, some will help you fight of the bandits, some will council you on how to sail better and in case of a storm, how to minimize risks and losses. If you wish, you can also send them to school to improve their abilities for additional cost. 4 seasons of the year that influence the prices of goods, open some paths for travel and block the others. They also impact the way the game looks, each city has a distinct look at different time of the year. Random blessings and curses that influence your statistics. They in turn affect how well you conduct business. A set of artifacts that influence your statistics or can help negate the effects of random events. A complex market fluctuation algorithm that include many variables such as: demand, supply, seasons of the year, localization of the city, random events like droughts or rat infestation.  A complex trading algorithm Over 100 quests each with multiple steps to success. 2 out of 10 planned mini games that accompany events with next ones upcoming in the updates Possibility to create a partnership with other traders and control 3 characters simultaneously 1 main and 2 quick scenarios 15 types of goods for trade with varying characteristics, some illegal, some perishable Beautiful hand-drawn localisations.  Your name is Olivean de Calinn, and this was supposed to be the most important day of your life. Your father has been preparing you, for all these years, for this exact moment. Your 21st birthday. You were finally a grown-up, able to take care of yourself, a person worthy of continuing your fathers' legacy. He wasn't born into money. To buy his first cart, he had to work very hard saving every silver and copper. One trade after trade, step after step, he climbed the ladder, transforming his tiny one-man venture into a trading company of a rather significant size. Then he met Van Talodd, the most famous merchant in the whole kingdom, and soon enough he entered into partnership. This enterprise proved very profitable, and Van Talodd promised your father something more precious than wealth. A lordship. Few weeks ago he left to the Capital – Ovoros – to accept the title. He was taking a little longer to come back than you expected, but recent weather was unfavourable, maybe he got stuck, or a road turned into a swamp... it happened all the time. It was almost dusk when you heard the knocking to the door. A messenger, his clothes soiled with mud, brought you a letter. There was no lordship, your father was found a traitor, an enemy of the Kingdom, and hanged for conspiring against the king, after a very hasty trial. All his assets and estate confiscated and handed over to the person who exposed the entire plot – Van Talodd. Suddenly everything became crystal clear, Van Talodd maimed him with promises of lordship, the only thing money can't buy. But his real purpose was to entrap your father and take over his fortune. Instead of your birthday present, you got carts full of kings' sell-swords approaching quickly. There was no time to loose, you had to run fast and far. Flee from the men that were certainly sent to kill you. That is only a beginning of your story, you're left with only your family ring that you had on you.  Take a fake name you need to avenge your father. Follow the same path as him, grow rich and destroy Van Talodd. The road there is hard and long – are you strong enough to make it?  Kaidan is a fictitious world, that was once a home to a space-faring civilization. It's history is almost unknown. Only that, once they developed starships, they relatively quickly left the planet. And on the remnants of the old civilization a new one has sprouted. A far less developed. If not for the artifacts left by the predecessors, they would be no different than a medieval country.","$14.99"

Your city starts with three stations. Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can. Each station can only hold a handful of waiting commuters so your subway network will need to be well-designed to avoid delays. The city is growing. More stations are opening, and commuters are appearing faster. The demands on your network are ever-increasing. You'll be constantly redesigning your lines to maximise efficiency. The new assets you earn every week will help immensely — as long as they're used wisely. Eventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly. Commuters will crowd the platforms. How long the city keeps moving is up to you. Key Features Compelling, constructive, hectic, relaxed gameplay. If that makes sense. It doesn't though, aye? You just gotta play it. Three game modes: Normal for quick scored games, Endless for stress-free sandbox play, and Extreme for the ultimate challenge. Build your metro exactly how you want to with the all-new Creative mode. Twenty real-world cities to design subways for (London, New York City, Paris, Berlin, Melbourne, Hong Kong, Osaka, Saint Petersburg, Montréal, San Francisco, São Paulo, Seoul, Washington, D.C., Cairo, Istanbul, Shanghai, Singapore, Stockholm, Mumbai, and Auckland). Each has a unique colour theme, set of obstacles, and pace. Random city growth, so each game plays out differently. A strategy that proved successful last game may not help you in the next. Each game's map is a work of art, built by you in the classic abstract subway style of Harry Beck. If you think it's a keeper, save it, tweet it, show it off or make it your desktop background! Responsive soundtrack created by your metro system, engineered by Disasterpeace. Colorblind and night modes. Trains! Did we mention them yet?

As an investigative reporter for the Irish magazine “Facts & Fancy,” Sarah Hamilton does not miss a beat as she receives hints that something strange is going on at the famous Bavarian castle Neuschwanstein. In the thrilling puzzle adventure Mystery of Neuschwanstein, Sarah and her new acquaintance Wolfgang Adler, a professor of historical criminology from Heidelberg, find themselves on a dangerous search for the truth behind Germany’s most famous unsolved death—the untimely death of the Fairy Tale King Ludwig II of Bavaria in 1886. Was his death in the shallows of Lake Starnberg the result of a successful suicide attempt, as the official sources claim? Or was it indeed murder? And who actually profited from the death of the monarch? This gorgeous castle is more than meets the eye. It conceals secret passages, hidden rooms, and other secrets! Sarah and Professor Adler will have to combine their knowledge and different skills to get to the bottom of things. But that is easier said than done when a mysterious monk starts passing on cryptic messages, and the first dead body turns up. The ambitious journalist and absent-minded Professor Adler will have to stay on the ball as they carry out their investigation; people are not as they seem, and some of them do not want the secrets of Neuschwanstein to see the light of day.  What is hidden behind the polite facade of the castellan Beatrix von Lohen, and what is the Italian building inspector Francetti really up to? And then there are rumors about the “Guglmänner,” though nobody knows what role they play in the web of conspiracies. Will you be able to accompany Sarah and Professor Adler through this adventure and solve the mystery of the fairy tale castle Neuschwanstein and the unexplained death of King Ludwig II?

Wield devastating weaponry as a Frontiersman marine, or become the xenomorph as a deadly Kharaa lifeform. Strategy Meets Shooter Natural Selection 2 is a First Person Shooter and Real Time Stategy game rolled into one! Each team, alien and human, has a Commander. The Commander looks down on the battlefield and issues orders, places structures, collects resources, researches technology, and deploys abilities. Here are some gameplay examples: A human Commander could drop health packs and ammunition to a trapped marine squad, and deploy sentry guns to help them defend their position. Or an alien Commander could grow a new Hive to spread infestation throughout newly captured territory, allowing more alien eggs to spawn... Two Unique Sides Aliens players choose to evolve into one of five lifeforms: The fast, fearsome Skulk can run on walls and deliver massive damage with its jaws. Lerks fly and deploy gasses to support their teammates in battle. Gorges heal other lifeforms and build tunnels, hydra turrets, walls, and other tactical structures. Fades blink in and out of battle, picking off marines with giant scythes. Finally, the giant Onos is so massive and so tough, that even entire marine squads can't take it down. Marines wield rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, pistols, and other weapons. Cluster grenades can clear ventilation shafts of sneaky Skulks, flamethrowers make short work of alien structures and infestation, and boosts dropped by the Commander increase combat effectiveness. When attacking on foot doesn't cut it, marines can construct hulking Exosuits wielding miniguns and railguns, and equip jetpacks for high speed assaults on alien Hives.

Their hard shells, their sharp claws and spines, their 10 legs that they can amputate in case of emergency, their compound eyes that allow them to see in all directions... They are beautiful fighting creatures, shaped by nature to survive with only their bodies in the hostile environment of the deep sea. In most video games, human beings shoot lasers and fly through the sky as if it’s nothing, but I asked myself the question: “What if lobsters and crabs had these kinds of powers?” Nature’s strategies sometimes far exceed the creativity of humans. If you reach a deadlock in the human struggles of your daily life, try turning your eyes towards nature; I’m sure you’ll find quite an unexpected battle for survival there.","$8.99"

NEOTOKYO° takes place about 30-40 years from now in a Japan that has drifted into social/political strife due to the inevitable stresses that come from changing times. The Japanese government is grappling with intensified external (Asia geopolitics) and internal (economic/social) problems, and there is mounting pressure from within Japan to return to the days when it exerted influence through military power and strength. A failed legislative push to alter the Japanese Constitution (allowing the Japanese military to engage in offensive actions outside of the country) leads to an attempted military coup by members of Japan's armed forces (GSDF). The coup fails, but was very close to succeeding. In an effort to suppress further coup attempts, Japan's Prime Minister forms a branch inside the Interior Ministry's National Security Forces (NSF) called GROUP SIX. They answer directly to the Prime Minister and are sworn to protect the Japanese Constitution at all costs. They immediately begin to hear rumors of a rogue element of the GSDF Special Forces (JINRAI) maneuvering for a second coup attempt. These JINRAI are Special Operations Group 43 (SOG43), fierce nationalist loyal to their love of country, and a desire to put Japan back into a position of strength and power. This begins the war in the shadows between the NSF and JINRAI.","Free"

It focuses on being distraction-free, simple, and fully customizable. Principles We built Nimble Writer with a couple principles in mind to make it stand out as a primary application for authors: Writing without distractions or worrying about formatting. Stay more organized with many useful organizational features. Materials of reference (such as photos, drawings, scribbles of text, character information, and much more) are available at your fingertips. Don't have any limitations to the default array of features. This means full customization, with a fully customizable and scriptable interface. Turn off features you don't need, change the entire look and feel of your writing environment, and much more. If you are used to writing stories in applications such as Word or other regular office tools, you'll find that Nimble Writer will be able to help you organize bundles of stories and notes together much simpler and faster. In addition, Nimble Writer is able to import some of those old documents and convert them into the Nimble Writer format. Advantages over traditional software Traditional writing software such as Word, Open Office or Google Docs are made just for the purpose of writing, so they don't have anything that helps story writers manage their notes and reference material, and neither does it offer much customization. They don't have any kind of chapter management either. Nimble Writer has all of those things, making it a much more productive choice for story writing. Steam's advantages With Nimble Writer's presence on Steam we can use the power that Steam's platform brings us, such as Steam Cloud . This means that you will be able to save your stories and notes entirely on Steam's cloud servers, so that you can load up your stories on another computer as well, just as easy! Don't forget about Steam Workshop ! With the implementation of the Workshop, you'll be able to share interface themes and addons with the world, or just to customize the app with other people's addons! Share creativity!","$9.99"

Now Steve and his expanding roster of dubious heroes must wield their unique skills to shoot, slide, dive, and take cover behind a political platform built on ethics, accountability, and an inordinate amount of gunfire. Eliminate the criminal underworld of the city’s three major districts and persuade undecided voters to your cause, tackling the issues that matter by putting a gun in the mouth of those issues. Through the power of ISO-Slant™ technology and a wasted youth, London-based developer Roll7 (OlliOlli) delivers the greatest 2¼D cover-based indie shooter of all-time, ever. Next Level Shootouts – Use reasonable force unreasonably in a dynamic mix of run-and-gun gameplay and cover-based shootouts. The intuitive quick-snap cover system lets you slide, roll, and dive into cover, dodging enemy fire before fighting back with tackles, executions, and 100s of bullets. Roster of Not Heroes - Select between 9 different heroes, each with their own distinct gameplay style and crime murdering abilities. Blast the city’s scum through doors with Cletus’ a shotgun, slice them in half with Kimmy’s katana dash, or simply bash crime in it’s terrible face with Ronald’s hammer. Dynamic Missions – Go ham on primary objectives and (sometimes random) secondary goals but be prepared for unexpected mid-level events that turn the tables on the anti-heroes in an instant. SWAT teams, gun-toting elderly, helicopter gunships, pandas, pugs and suicidal samurais stand between you and victory.

Put your kung-fu to the ultimate test in the survival mode. One Finger Death Punch is a game you can “feel”. The direct connection between your mouse and your character on the screen will be a new experience for many players. When you string together a long, complex string of kills, it feels like something “you” did rather than something the game let you do. When you play it you feel like you’re actually playing a Xiao Xiao stick animation video. We took inspiration from every kung-fu film we’ve seen. Every bit of effort was poured into delivering an easy to play game that was as addictive to play as Tetris. Every Press Matters! DO NOT BUTTON MASH! One of the biggest challenges we had while making the game is stopping the player from button mashing. When our friends play tested our game they’d instinctively button mash, they couldn’t help themselves. It must have been the many years of playing other brawlers that engraved it in their minds the notion of rapidly pressing buttons to kill your foes. The game’s designed in such a way that if you button mash, you die. Every press matters. Although playing the game should still be simple, you see a bad guy in front of you, you attack him, he dies. If you punch even once when there’s no enemy in front of you, you’re going to miss. If you miss, chances are you’re going to get hit. It’s a simple system but it’s ruthless to button mashers. We spent much time setting up visual and audio queues as well as many warnings trying to steer players away from their natural button mashing tendencies.","$4.99"

You play as a commander for HEROCORP™, the 4th largest private military organization in the galaxy. A long period of peace has left the company coffers a little bare so the science division developed Trans-Dimensional Rifts, opening up lucrative opportunities for war in other universes.

As long as you complete the missions under budget and fill out the TPS reports in triplicate, everything goes smoothly. Is pre-emptively defending Earth ethical? Who cares when the money’s good!

When her teacher stepped out of the classroom a month ago, Cordy never imagined he would be gone for good. Now her fellow students have turned on each other as the school descends into chaos. Cordy must battle feral classmates and dangerous creatures as she ascends to the cruel Administrators’ offices atop the Edgewood Home for Lost Children. Our Darker Purpose is a top-down, rogue-like action RPG that combines the ingenuity of genre-defining classics with the expansiveness and accessibility of modern day action adventure games. The gameplay is steeped in a variety of influences ranging from A Link to the Past to The Binding of Isaac to Diablo. We love games with great mechanics and awesome, bizarre storylines, and that’s what we’re creating with Our Darker Purpose. Each playthrough features a unique set of procedurally generated levels. Death is permanent, but your accomplishments earn you resources to buy lesson and upgrades in the afterlife... and your education lasts forever. Every game teaches you more about the Edgewood Home for Lost Children, the disappearance of the adults, and the darker purpose of the Administrators. Key Features Fast-Paced, Combat-Oriented Gameplay : Face unique boss encounters and challenging enemy mechanics! The Edgewood Home is a merciless environment. Dodge between fireballs and flying desks while your former classmates try to pummel you into the walls, and that’s just the lower levels… Character Variety and Customization : Assemble selections of randomized perks and upgrades to reflect your play-style – tanky bruiser, glass cannon, fleet-footed assassin, or anything else. Assemble your skills into devastating combinations… or pick style perks with no benefit at all, at your peril. Oh Yeah, and It Takes Place in a Sinister Orphanage : Prepare for a an unflinching look at what happens when an already terrifying boarding school/orphanage goes all Lord of the Flies, and try not to get eaten by any of the possessed furniture. Only the psychologically strongest gamers will be able to withstand the insightful taunts of the Administrators themselves… Gameplay Allocate precious skills Uncovering Edgewood’s dark secrets will yield valuable experience for Cordy. Each time she levels up, you’ll be able to select from one of two new abilities that she can acquire, depending on your play style and the situation at hand. You will never be as strong as you need to be, so prepare for some nail-biting choices… Choose your own ghastly fate The house is different every game, and every level is uniquely generated. But fear not, there’s more than one way to ascend through a dystopic Victorian manor! Pick your route – would you rather battle a feral horde than risk an encounter with the dangerous Capulets? The choice is yours! Of course, each floor offers unique credit tokens to buy new upgrades, so choose wisely… Acquire eternal powers Adorable, creepy, stylized Edgewood Home students don’t give up when they fail --- they go to class. Each time you lead Cordy to a fiery (or chalky, or spikey, or venomy, or monstery) demise, you get some time to strategize with your kindly scarecrow guidance counselor. He is happy to offer his one-of-a-kind insight in many academic disciplines…","$14.99"

There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?

Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly.

There are four acts in total, each with a powerful boss at their climax. Every dungeon is filled to the brim with aggressive and deadly enemies. As Pixel Boy you will encounter swarms of giant ants, packs of snapping dogs and even lethal dungeon birds. To help Pixel Boy bear this burden there are many tools at your disposal. Various pixel powerups can be found or purchased to help Pixel Boy overcome the treacherous dungeons beneath Resolutia. Spreadshot, Shields, Splitshot, Heat seekers, Critical Strike Modifiers, Time Stoppers and much more are available.

Various types and tiers of armours can be crafted by obtaining the appropriate armour orbs dropped within the dungeons depths. Each piece of armour has different effects, abilities and levels of power dependent on its tier and orbs used to create it. Throughout the dungeon Pixel Boy may encounter a variety of randomly generated unique rooms. Make sure Pixel Boy pockets any keys he finds, as treasure rooms have chests that are always locked to protect their secrets. Be wary every time Pixel Boy moves from room to room, as simply entering a room could trigger a dangerous trap; locking him in the room until every monster has been defeated within. Pixel Boy should also pay close attention to torches as they could lead the way to secrets and treasures. Collect all the coins Pixel Boy finds and spend them on items, powerups and armour at the shops back in town.

This story features a 17X8km world map with many unique character, landscapes, biomes, locations, and over 140 types of potential enemies.

That can still eventually arrive at the ending. And yes, there is an ending. Story mode also features coop with other players. Adventure Mode – This mode is based on a procedural map generated from a seed. It comes in a 40X40 kilometer map. Players will be able to complete random missions, defeat bosses, dive through dungeons, and explore different landscapes. This mode also features survival and versus. Build Mode – In this mode, there are no enemies and an infinite amount of building material. It also currently comes in a 40X40km map.

PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat.

With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.   THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.  MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.  ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable.

Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.  CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.

Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer: Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.  OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization.

The mighty kingdoms of Spain, England, France and the Netherlands fight over the colonies. And there you are, a young sea captain whose only goal is to become the most powerful man in the New World. To achieve that goal, you may choose one of the two available campaigns: will you become an Adventurer or a Trader? If you chose the way of the Adventurer, lead an unforgiving campaign for the conquest of the seas: invasion, piracy, bounty hunting, raiding; do whatever it takes to build your own empire in the Caribbean. And of course, trade will have a less important role to play in your rise. The way of the Trader is, on the opposite, mostly about developing your riches and your economic power. To be the most powerful Trader of the New World, you have to create trade routes, build industries and develop the economy of the colonies. Of course, in Free Play mode, you can mix both of those in any way you want, letting you create your own unique and exciting story. For the first time in the acclaimed Port Royale series, you are not alone in the beautiful and seemingly so peaceful seas of the Caribbean. The Multiplayer mode allows up to 4 players to play through LAN or over the Internet. Develop a successful trading company, lead your ships in beautiful 3D naval battles and force your opponents to their knees!

The key to success lies in good planning by season, expert knowledge that you acquire throughout the game, and skill and good old-fashioned hard work.

Many tractors and farm machines (combine harvesters, field choppers, attaching parts and trailers, etc.) by renowned manufacturers are available to cultivate the farm and manage all the work.  Only good planning and hard work will turn fallow earth into a flourishing and fertile soil.

No more frustrating replays performing the same sequence over and over again. Just rewind and fix. Single Player Cooperation This is the key part of the game. You can exist in many parallel timelines using time clones. It means that every time you need a friend's help in the game, you can be that friend. You can spawn a new time clone at any position and time in the game, and once you create a new one it’s there forever. Multiple true timelines Time clones will continue to perform the actions you recorded. They are, however, still a part of the game world, and if you change the game world the end result will also change. Temporality fielded objects A temporality fielded object is an object that won’t be affected by your time manipulations, because it is inside a field that cancels out all timelines except the original one. The Paradox Effect Combining the true timelines with the temporality fielding allows us to create paradox based puzzles where one single timelines performs multiple different actions depending from where in time it is viewed.

"Regimental Chess","app","Regimental Chess is a battle game where large armies of chess pieces move and capture in mass formations. Up to 372 pieces in a single battle.","Apr 29, 2015","Thomas Bacon","Regimental Chess Inc.,Regimental Chess Inc.","Free to Play,Strategy,Chess","Multi-player,Cross-Platform Multiplayer","English",NA,"Free to Play,Strategy"," About This Game Regimental Chess was generated from the desire to create a solid game emulating the strategy and tactics of battle. Strategy being the art of positioning ones formations. Tactics being the art of how they fight. At first, the creator of this game increased the number of pieces and the size of the battlefield.  The quick realization is that chess evolved into, and solidified, into a board 8 squares by 8 squares for good reason. The two small armies are therein locked into combat where every position counts.  Increase the size of the field or the army, and all that is lost.  Then came the epiphany: move multiple pieces in formations rather than just one piece at a time. Formations that are governed by rules.  Formations that can be broken apart.  No point system is necessary. If a formation breaks up or loses pieces through attrition, it simply becomes less effective as a fighting unit until it is either annihilated or becomes too small to remain relevant to the battle.  It then became a matter of experimenting with the numbers of pieces and size of the board to create a balance whereby every formation plays an important role in any given game.  In the Napoleonic Wars, well formed infantries defeated the cavalry charge because horses refused to charge into a wall of bayonets held by foot soldiers that no longer turned to run. But the same densely packed infantry made an easy target for an artillery strike. The artillery, in turn, was itself  vulnerable to a cavalry charge. This historic dynamic of rock-paper-scissors underpins the balance of Regimental Chess.  The king is most often captured by a formation of rooks and queens, acting like a heavy artillery.  However, this group has a difficult time capturing the king if he is surrounded by his horses. Because of the way they are formed and move, the horses are extremely vulnerable to charge of densely packed infantry. This infantry, in turn, can be quickly wiped out by the rooks and queens.  It is all a matter of how many pieces are in each formation, how the formation is shaped and where it stands in relation to its enemies. For this reason, an immediate strike by bishops, albeit sacrificial, is best intended to wipe out as many rooks, queens and horses as possible, break up their formations and thus reduce the opponent’s offensive and defensive capabilities.  Multiple Board Regimental Chess emulates the battle a general must wage along a broad front, with multiple divisions and commands, each carrying out and issuing orders. Each division protects the flank of the next division. Forces must shift along the backfield to defend against points of attack, or to mass forces and attack where opportunity presents itself.  After all is said and done, we’re extremely pleased with the game we’ve created and we hope you enjoy it as much.  If your intellect has a brutal streak, or your brutality has an intelligent edge, this is the game for you.","Free to Play"

Command an adorable but deadly army of sentient ""puppets"" on a quest to claim an artifact said to grant any wish. Craft your team the way you want, draft each into a class that fits your battalion, and control the battlefield to attain victory. Livia's story Players follow the journey of Livia, a young girl whose village has fallen victim to a terrible disease. With no known cure in sight, Livia resorts to venturing into a mysterious tower on the outskirts of the village, said to house an artifact capable of granting any wish. Having no idea what lies ahead, Livia bravely steps into the tower...and into the greatest adventure of her life. Classic Tactical Combat Rime Berta uses classic SRPG mechanics that gamers have grown to love. Units move across a grid-based battlefield with variable height, and can attack using a variety of single target and area-of-effect attacks. How you own the battlefield is up to you. Will you overwhelm individual units with brute force on an even playing field, or will you use the environment to your advantage, and funnel enemies into a valley before springing your attack? Each class has its own share of strengths and weaknesses, and it's up to you to make sure you use it to your advantage. Reactive Turn Battle In Rime Berta, while your fights are turn based, it doesn't mean you're defenseless when the enemy is moving into place. Using powerful ""reaction"" skills, you can set your units to react to specific condition changes in the battlefield. Once set, these skills will activate during the enemy's turn, allowing you to quickly retaliate when the tide begins to turn. Leveling & Evolving As your units fight and grow stronger, they will learn a plethora of new skills. Switch in and out the skills you need to customize your units to fit your strategy. Even within individual classes, there's plenty of customization to be found. Learn the right skills for your units, and they'll have the ability to change to a new hybrid class with its own set of unique skills and spells.

In battle, Zetterburn uses no weapons except for his razor-sharp claws and ability to control flame. BURN DAMAGE - Zetterburn's special attacks can set opponents on fire, causing them additional damage over time. WILD FIRE - Zetterburn's Down Special places flames on the stage. These flames stay for a period of time, burning any opponents who come in contact with them. FIRE AMP - When an opponent is burning, Zetterburn's Strong Attacks can absorb the flames and launch the burned enemy twice as far, making for an effective killing blow. Orcane is a playful trickster, notorious for escaping even the most precarious of situations. He can transform into water and confuse enemies with a spray of bubbles. PUDDLE TELEPORTATION - Orcane creates a puddle with his Neutral Special or Down Special. He can then teleport to his puddle using his Up Special as a powerful vertical blow or an effective recovery when launched off the stage. BUBBLE EVAPORATION - Orcane can turn his puddle into a pillar of bubbles with his Down Special to trap enemies above the puddle. WATER AMP - When standing on top of his puddle, Orcane can consume the water underneath him to perform powerful Strong Attacks with far greater range and knockback. The youngest trainee in the history of the Air Academy, Wrastor has never lived by anyone's rules but his own. Currently an Aerial Ace for the Air Armada, Wrastor is wrecking havoc among the Armada's enemies and generals alike. WINGED FLIGHT - Wrastor can jump 4 times, making him incredible at controlling the air and recovering from the toughest falls even when things look grim. WIND CURRENT - Wrastor can create a Wind Current with his Forward Special, allowing him to move faster within it and chase his targets more effectively. AERIAL ACE - Wrastor performs his charged Strong Attacks in the air instead of on the ground, a first for this genre. Kragg is a defender of the colossal Aetherian Forest. Deliberate and loyal, he is one of the infamous Wall Runners who patrol the Rock Wall. Unlike other Wall Runners, Kragg has the legendary ability to control the earth with his will. ROCK HURL - Kragg can pull a rock out of the ground and hurl it at opponents. After it leaves his hands, the rock becomes a solid piece of stage that either Kragg or other players can break. DEFENSE BALL - Kragg can curl into a ball and roll toward enemies. Although he can be damaged while in ball form, he cannot be knocked away. EARTH PILLAR - Kragg can summon a pillar of earth to his feet regardless of where he is. If Kragg is about to fall to his death, this move can quickly turn his situation around. Forsburn is the disgraced, eldest son of the Firelands' ruling family. After being condemned by the Fire Council and his own brother, Forsburn found refuge in a group of outsiders who had rejected the flame and mastered the way of smoke. SMOKE SCREEN - Forsburn can use his Neutral Special to obscure the battlefield allowing Forsburn to remain hidden inside a cloud of smoke. DECOY - Through his Forward Special, Forsburn can create a smoke facsimile of himself that can attack opponents. The illusory Forsburn breaks into smoke after being hit by a single attack. CONSUME/COMBUST - By using his Down Special, Forsburn can consume his smoke clouds back into his body. After consuming three clouds, Forsburn is charged up and can use Down Special again to combust: knocking opponents away at high speed. Maypul is the self-appointed Guardian of the Aetherian Forest. She commands fearful respect throughout the forest for her unhesitating vigilantism. She uses her agility to trap any unknown intruders before they even realize she is there. WATCHER'S MARK - Maypul can use her Seeds or her Watcher's Dash to mark opponents, making them susceptible to her following attacks. WRAPPED UP - After marking her targets, Maypul can use her Strong Attacks or her trusty Plant to wrap marked opponents in place allowing her to follow up with another attack. SLING SHOT - Maypul can use her vines to sling toward marked opponents, allowing her to elude attacks and quickly close distances. Absa is a famed engineer and martialist of the Elders of the Air Alliance. Despite the laws of the Elders, Absa secretly developed storm techniques in the caves of the Archai mountains. CLOUD CONTROL - Absa can place a cloud using her Neutral or Forward Special. This cloud hangs in the air until Absa bursts it by tapping her Neutral Special and knocking enemies away. THUNDER BOLT - Absa can charge her Neutral Special to create a powerful lightning blast that connects her to her cloud. All opponents caught between the two will be knocked away at high speeds. CONDENSED STORM - Absa focuses the power of a lightning bolt to the tip of her hoof. If she can line up one of her aerial kicks perfectly, she unleashes great power. Etalus is a legendary warrior in his native land. He is one of the last surviving members of the Harbor Guard and uses the power of ice to augment his massive strength. HOME ICE ADVANTAGE: Etalus can use his Forward Special or Forward Tilt to freeze the ground beneath him in order to slide across on the icy surface. ARMORED UP: When standing on ice, Etalus can use his Neutral Special to absorb the ice and create ice armor around his body. AVALANCHE: Etalus can use his Down Special to shatter all nearby ice, instantly freezing any enemies who are standing on it. ","$14.99"

However, both spaceships and droids are dependent on ‘Neonium’ for their power.  However, this new source of energy was only found in the moons of Pluto and deposits are very limited, so the search started for a new supply. Scouts ships discovered that a distant planet known as Praymos has rich deposits of Neonium.  The only trouble is Praymos is not only inhabited but has a technological civilization similar to that of Earth of the second half of 20th century.  The result was a battle not just for control of the resource, but the entire planet. Gameplay RoboWars is easy to play yet difficult to master.  Each level has its own unique set of tactics – master the tactics and push on to victory!  Select your cards wisely – deploy them even more carefully. Build your defenses to prevent the capture of your flags by the enemy. Place your units or set your traps; earn the right special abilities. In between attacks, construct new defenses. Manage your supplies of Neonium well – the more you have, the more special abilities cards will be available.  The cards allow you to build battlefield towers, units and traps or to activate abilities. Build Neonium production plants for even more special ability cards. Destroyed enemy units will sometimes drop money, which can be used to buy units, traps, and attack cards. Features More than 50 types of units, towers, abilities and powerful bosses!

Since its debut 15 years ago, the beloved game-making engine has introduced untold amounts of users to the wonders of game design and continues to be a powerful, user-friendly tool. No other engine in the RPG Maker series comes closer to the classic late-80s/early-90s feel, with graphics and a battle system that hit the nostalgic sweet spot while still offering huge opportunities for innovation. With a brand new translation and updates, this is the best version of the classic engine you’re going to find! Key Features: -Classic Front-View Battle System: Recalling the earliest days of the console RPG, this vintage layout hasn’t lost its thrill. Creating fights can be learned in minutes but there is major potential for surprising, dynamic battles once all the different conditions and events are mastered. -Straightforward, User-Friendly Interface: RPG Maker engines are designed to be as flexible as possible while still being user friendly, and RPG Maker 2000 is one of the earliest examples. Virtually everything in the engine is managed through a simple point-and-click interface. All of your game’s characters, enemies, skills, animations, and equipment are created and stored in an easy-to-navigate database. An in-depth event system contains dozens of functions to help make your story and world come to life, such as custom messages, character movement, player choices, special effects, and more. Plus, RPG Maker 2000’s powerful map editor is extremely easy to master, allowing you to craft your world tile by tile with unprecedented efficiency! -Retro Aesthetic and Huge Customization : RPG Maker 2000 allows you to create games that look just like ones from the storied history of console RPGs.

Players choose from 6 distinct robot characters of varying personality, ability, and weaponry, forming two teams of 3 robots. Players must work with their teammates to attack enemy robots until they are turned into bins of scrap, then transport the bins back to their base as scraps for recycling. It’s capture-the-flag where the players are the flags! Once a team has collected enough scraps, they can create the mighty giant robot, El Rey Gigante Robo Jr., and unleash him to destroy the enemy base and win! THE STORY After years of making a mess of things, mankind has finally given up and left Earth to find a new planet to trash. Left behind were the machines that once dutifully served their human masters. Among these were the robots of arch-rival companies Robotic Engineering Depot (RED) and Blucom Discarded Plastics and Metals. With nothing else to do, these now-leaderless robots escalated their competition into fierce combat. Both sides are now desperately collecting materials to create a giant robot powerful enough to destroy the other. The RUSTBUCKET RUMBLE has begun! ROBOT CLASSES Clancy Grunt Model CLN-C has probably taken one too many hits, bullets, and rockets to the head, but he never gives up. Always helpful, Clancy is quick to heal teammates or provide cover fire from his automatic rifle. He doesn’t have any fancy gadgets to carry scraps, because he doesn’t need them. All Clancy needs to retrieve scraps is just some good old fashion determination and his metal robot arms. Daisy Engineer Model QT-3.14 has a cute and cheerful appearance, but make no mistake — Daisy is a technician of pain and punishment. Small in stature, she commands a powerful mech suit to help her build sentry turrets and carry drones. And she’s happy to get into the fray with her roller bomb launcher. Kasumi Ninja Model KA5-M13 was originally built for non-combat purposes. After the humans left, she finally got to pursue her dream of being a ninja assassin, but with a modern twist. Holograms, smoke bombs, and a cyber sword help her quickly dismantle enemies before they even know what happened. Bjorn Brute Model HPM4X has an imposing stature and makes the most of it. Running head first into danger, he uses his powerful flamethrower to decimate enemies. His energy shield keeps him alive even in the worst conditions, and he’s so strong that he can easily toss scraps to his teammates. Valentina Sniper Model H0RN3T is as calm as she is deadly. Cold and calculating, she finds that the best place to position herself during combat is just out of sight from her foes. After dropping an enemy, she uses her extending grabber claw to retrieve scraps from afar. Even if her opponents do get the jump on her, she never loses her cool and uses stun grenades and a short range rapid-fire pistol to hold them off. Maverick Bombardier Model DNGR-Z0N is a show-off. Thinking his jetpack puts him above the competition, he’s developed a cocky, prideful demeanor. His jetpack allows him to maneuver in and out of combat with ease and perform bombing runs. If he’s not careful, then Maverick may find himself in dangerous situations. But little do his foes know, that’s right where he wants to be. The danger zone. And when it seems like Maverick has bitten off more than he can chew; he uses his trusty rocket launcher to help even the odds. He can fly, get a burst of speed, and drop a number of bombs to the unfortunate robots below.","Free"

Each weapon comes with its own unique advantages and disadvantages, encouraging wildly different play styles. These include not only the way a weapon shoots but also the 'tells' the weapon leaves such as the smoke from the blunderbuss or the trail of fire behind the Hobby Horse. From traditional favourites such as Deathmatch to the completely unique Murder Mystery that challenges you to find and frag your specific target with a specific weapon. Play in teams or all against all. Challenge up to seven of your mates on the couch or online or a combination of both, the game is always split screen whether you are on or offline. When your friends aren't around, train your skills and learn the maps in the solo time trials or play against AI bots. In the spirit of the best arena shooters you’ll spend time traversing 11 maps via air vents and trampolines until you’ve acquired your target and fragged them accordingly. Each map is designed with colour-coded areas as well as plentiful landmarks such as statues, paintings and furniture that allow you to quickly locate other players without being able to actually see them. Inspired by games like Towerfall we've provided players with a highly granular level of customisation to play the game the way they want to. Choose which weapons you'll allow, how and when they can be swapped or reloaded, apply time limits, adjust the victory conditions, penalties and more.

Secret Ponchos is a beautiful but deadly competitive PvP fighting game set in a stylish Spaghetti Western universe. The isometric gameplay is team based and unlike any fighting game or MOBA you've played before. Combat is fast-paced, precise and merciless, resulting in a competitive environment where skills matter. There is no auto-attacking or hand-holding – every shot is a skill-shot!  Surviving in the Wild West will not be easy. You’ll be squaring off against the deadliest outlaws in 3v3 shootouts and 1v1 duels. It’s your ability to out maneuver your opponent (range control, timing, accuracy), your cunning team play, and your strategic use of the environment that will determine whether you collect the bounty on your enemies heads or they collect yours.  The “Most Wanted Edition” brings a heavily expanded version of Secret Ponchos to Steam. Switchblade Monkeys, the indie developers behind Secret Ponchos (that’s us!), are a small group of friends that have been building Secret Ponchos from their homes for the last 6 years. They worked closely over this last year with the Early Access community to refine features, and add more than double the game’s content (including an enhanced character roster, new maps, and all-new game modes) and are now proud to present the official release. ""The Most Wanted Edition"" of Secret Ponchos was showcased at EVO 2015 this year, and received an incredibly strong reception from the competitive community.  From the fighting game community... ""Played this game at EVO and had to come back for more. Fast-paced, strategic, and fresh game-play, it's a blast to play and even more fun to win."" - Skisonic, EVO Commentator ""Secret Ponchos is that sleeper OP game that I think everyone needs in their Steam library ASAP"" - TKbreezy, Smash Commentator EVERY SHOT IS A SKILL SHOT!! Think you're good at PVP?  Skill shots mean you actually have to land the shot using yourself, by using accuracy, good spacing, and timing. There is no auto attack or aim locking to hold your hand. Secret Ponchos is a game where you can only rely on your gameplay skills, reflexes, timing, and precision.  Secret Ponchos was not built as a MOBA, but as a fighting game that supports fast paced team combat. Team play is an amazing fit with a fighting game. Form a Spaghetti Western gang of different outlaw classes, and enter the street to gun down your rivals  in an intense shootout.  Depth of combat: everything has a cost. While new players may simply run and gun at first, the deeper layers of combat create room for a skilled outlaw to control the fight. There are a large variety of attacks, but every choice and every action has a cost. Evading may get you into position quickly but costs stamina which you might have needed to escape. Every bullet matters since you have to manually reload. A heavy attack leaves you open for counter fire if you miss. To survive you need to be able to think under pressure. Key Features 10 Unique Outlaws: Each outlaw brings a unique gameplay style, weapons, and advantages for your team. They all carry a lot of depth, and play as different as they look. Line of Sight: Take cover behind the environment to break line-of-sight between you and your enemies. When taking cover you will disappear from an enemies’ view, allowing you to ambush, flank, or take a moment to regroup. Line of site and cover mechanics bring the environment into the shootout. Combat Modes: A fighting game that supports gang vs gang combat, setting it apart from the fighting game genre. It also includes traditional 1v1 standoffs for more intimate battles. AI bots & Arcade Mode: Arcade mode is a simple tournament against a roster of AI opponents (1v1). A great way to get comfortable with your Outlaw of choice. Add bots to your online matches (Unranked mode only) to refine your skills. Gain notoriety and level up your outlaw. Unlock perks, skins, and reputation classes as the bounty on your own head rises. Seasonal Leaderboards to see who is the most wanted. Gamepad Controller & Keyboard/Mouse Supported Secret Ponchos is a fighting game at its heart, we support controllers (PS4 DS4, Xbox 360 windows / XBONE windows controller or equivalent) & also Keyboard/Mouse.","$14.99"

Grays roam the land, largely in the absence of human interference.  These aren't your typical Zed -- theirs is a very different sort of apocalypse. Animals spontaneously transform into twisted, violent beings.  The earth decays, collapsing into a network of abysses.  The wilderness thickens. It has been nine years since That Day when it all started.  Pockets of humanity still exist, but are ignorant of one another.  Within these isolated havens people try to live as best they can -- for even in a world so broken and dark, daily life must go on. Darrell and Mary Williams were able to build such a life inside a five-acre fenced yard out in the country.  They were even secure enough in their isolated compound that they had a daughter five years after the zombie-like grays appeared. Life carried on as normally as it could, until another refugee on the run is killed during a nearby attack. Her son is saved and taken in by the Williamses -- who do not realize that this kind action will destroy their home and threaten their entire family.  They find themselves caught in the midst of a struggle between two eldritch horrors, and the path to survival is anything but clear. Key Features Solve environmental puzzles under pressure.  Figure out how to use the tools, traps, and weapons in each level to clear all the Grays. Nearly 100 hand-crafted levels with multiple difficulty levels ranging between casual and hardcore, developed end to end by two experienced adventure level designers.

Shoppe Keep challenges you to shrewdly set the price of each item and watch the money roll in – but if your stock is too expensive, you will find your supplies shrinking as stealing increases! Stop Thieves quickly, with a swing of your sword or a zap of a lightning spell! (Or maybe both, if you’re really bloodthirsty.) Price your wares competitively and great adventurers will travel from miles away to your one-stop shop to spend their gold – the gold that they probably found conveniently placed on a cave floor! Shoppe Keep delivers deep gameplay mechanics in a memorable, tongue-in-cheek world. Gone are the days of testing the theoretical water – we’re now a fully-fledged, fully-opened store! We even have an inn! This building has been blocked off for some time, and many have speculated that it will be an Inn – well, the sneaky players were right! The Inn is best used at lower levels and a lower gold count. For a small amount of kPoints, you are able to unlock the Inn with a single table for four guests. An inn with a single table? What complete rubbish! Additional tables can be purchased by speaking with the innkeeper, as well as additional upgrades that will help your Inn deliver serious coin. Adventurers traveling through town might want to visit the Inn and enjoy some food and ale – if they haven’t found some randomly laying around on their travels already. We all know that fantasy worlds cater for their heroes – but with Shoppe Keep, you’ll be able to make sure that catering doesn’t equal ‘potato in a toilet’! Various members of four completely original and never before seen character classes will visit your store, including hardened warriors, magical mages, sneaky rogues and wise druids. (As you can tell, we’re taking this description text VERY seriously!) Each of these character types will seek to purchase items relating to their unique skill set - a warrior will be hard-pressed to take a flimsy magical robe into close quarters’ battle, for instance! Mages, however, will be perfectly happy with a wooden stick. It’s ‘magical’, or something ridiculous those absurd mages believe. Will you be able to accommodate for all four classes of customers? You have a completely unreasonable clientele to add pressure to your role as a Shoppe Keeper. After a day of heroism, beating up goblins and even battling the great ol’ Dragonclaw, your customers can be just a little short-fused. This means your displays can be spoilt and your tables may be damaged by angry customers! The renegade ‘heroes’ are not too worried about bringing in dirt from the street either! However, help is at hand! As the owner of the store you’ll be armed with various exciting tools for combating these issues. The mighty wooden broomstick will sweep away dirt brought in from your customers, and the great hammer will repair furniture damaged by these ‘extraordinary’ visitors. A few sweeps and a couple of swings means that your shop will be in tip-top shape. Grow your business, and you can employ an army of ‘Helper Bots’ to take care of this for you – the cutting edge in imaginary technology that totally exists. Set your prices too high and your customers may think twice about investing their hard won (or stolen) gold in your shop. They’ll take the plunge and attempt to steal stock right under your nose! With no CCTV available in ye olde world of Shoppe Keep, you have to rely on your combat skill! A sharp swing of the sword or the zap of a magic spell can make quick work of these pesky Thieves. But be cautious not to hit any innocent bystanders or you’ll suffer a monetary penalty, as well as a life riddled with guilt! Not to mention the hideous moral conundrum of whether or not to tell your family or- look, just don’t kill innocent people. And let’s not forget the ferocious Barbarians! They live on the outskirts of the city, looming like an ancient race of organic-synthetic hybrids that invade the gal- wait, wrong game. Regularly invading the town, Barbarians will cause as much damage and destruction as possible! They will even fight you directly if you try to stop them. Eliminate a few dozen Barbarians and they’ll invite a much… larger friend to come and visit you. But what will you do with all the bodies? Unless you wish to display the corpses as examples to your customers, you monster, you’ll need to use either the broomstick or the grinder. It’s tough running a shop (especially one that may or may not be the venue of a murder-fest); there are not enough hours in the day to go out and procure new items for yourself. Thankfully, you can employ a Champion, unlocked via the skill tree. Select a class, equip the Champion with your finest armour and weapons, and send them out to bring home rare new wares. Despite that awful half-rhyme, some of these items can be sold, some are junk and others can be crafted into more powerful gear. Your Champion will need to gain experience, just like the fantasy heroes you’re familiar with. During their first outing, they may fall in battle (and regret not saving more recently!), and whilst they will not return with any new goods, the experience will have taught them valuable skills that will improve their chances next time. ‘Helper Bots’ are your robotic staff team. The MK III charts the latest iteration of this tech, increasing the artificial intelligence of this mechanical chap. We all knew that true AI technology would be created before CCTV – it was inevitable. The ‘Helper Bot’ has three duties; zapping Thieves who attempt to steal from your shop, picking up items that customers may have thrown to the floor, and restocking items back on the shelves. You can purchase several ‘Helper Bots’ to, well, help run your shop. Make a living for yourself in a tongue-in-cheek fantasy world FEATURES Make a living for yourself in a tongue-in-cheek fantasy world Manage your own Shoppe, from ordering stock to setting prices Design your own Shoppe layout by ordering tables, shelves and weapon racks The world of Shoppe Keep reacts to your every Shoppe decision, including prices and stock quality Unlock new abilities and perks in the skill menu, including alchemy, harvesting, and the capability to own a grinder and a high tier stock. We’ll let you decide what to do with the grinder Use the ‘Helper Bots’ to collect items thrown down in disgust by customers, zap Thieves and restock items Create a Champion, select its class and send them out on grand adventures Arm yourself with a sword and magic spells to defend your Shoppe from cheeky Thieves and destructive Barbarians Maintain your Shoppe by using the hammer to repair furniture and the broom to sweep away dirt, as well as the occasional corpse The world cycles through 4 seasons, each featuring a most wanted item.

If deemed worthy, you will be assigned as an officer in the shadowy halls of Facility 7C. You will remotely lead a squad of operatives on daring espionage missions to plant evidence, steal secrets, assassinate targets, and perform sabotage for the glory of the Dark Father. Do you have enough faith to follow orders unquestioningly? Yours truly in darkness, Signal Ops is a played in a first-person perspective, but when you're playing a mission you actually simultaneously control multiple agents, each with their own first-person view. You'll need to take advantage of the multiple views to keep an eye on key areas, formulate strategies to complete your goals, and solve puzzles that require you to be in more than one place at a time. With the shoddy equipment and dubiously trained agents provided to you, you’ll need all the advantages you can muster. Signal Ops blends elements of a tactical shooter, stealth, strategy, and puzzle solving. Your squad can be customized each mission by selecting from six agents with unique abilities and equipment. Some agents are geared towards sneaky play, and others are more combat oriented. You'll usually find yourself using a mix of both stealth and combat, and this can also vary depending on the mission. A lot of elements in Signal Ops have a hardcore, old-school appeal to them. For example: you will often need to use your map to plan your moves in open levels, and health does not magically regenerate. Don't worry though, agents are a dime a dozen. As long as you still have an agent alive, you can call in reinforcements to replace those unlucky ones that had too much lead for breakfast. The radio is where the signal in Signal Ops comes from. Since you are sitting comfortably back at base commanding your agents in the field, you'll need to position radio equipment in order to keep in contact with them. BOLT : Your electronics expert who acts as the center of your field operations. WRENCH : A mechanical specialist for sneaky entrances. SPY : A master of disguise who's art of conversation can turn the tides. SCOPE : A skilled marksman and infiltrator. SHIELD : The combat specialist who's got your back.

Slip is not for the faint of heart. It has an immense focus on timing and features devilishly tricky level design. Utilizing your two colors, absorb damage from incoming projectiles of the same color, or be destroyed immediately by the opposite color. Additionally, Slip features colored Geometry that you only interact with when you share its color. This is perfect when you need a place to stand, but can result in instant death if you land on a set of spikes sharing your color. In addition to color based obstacles, Slip is also host to numerous Color driven props. Sharing the color of a launch-ring will shoot you in the direction it faces. Match the color of a gravity well to get sucked in and color swap again to have it launch you in which ever direction you are spinning. Lastly, utilize the phase shift platforms to shift vertically in the direction of your color. Game Progression: Slip is split up into 12 levels with an overworld connecting them. Game progression is linear with each level being unlocked when the level before it is beaten. Each level features a plethora of deadly obstacles that result in instant death. However, since the game can be quite difficult, there are frequent checkpoints laid throughout each level. Lives are NOT limited. You can press on until your thumbs are weary. At the end of every level there is a mini-boss or boss encounter. During these sequences the game switches to an autorun mode where the player can adjust their position on screen by moving left or right. Here, positioning can mean the difference between life and death. Why we run: The story of Slip. You play as the devilishly cubie protagonist. You've always been pretty awesome with your ability to swap between 2 colors. You're a pretty sweet deal. Your nemesis Steve, on the other hand, is gross and smooth, nasty and organic. His color is that of a sickly peach. Why doesn't he just swap colors like you? Because he can't. Because he's Steve. In his early years Steve idolized you. He wanted to be you. After a failed attempt to become your sidekick (you don't have sidekicks since you're not a superhero) Steve began to seclude himself from the world. His envy of you grew and turned to hatred and resentment. He worked tirelessly in his lab creating all forms of horrible beings. His greatest triumph however has just been unleashed upon you. You couldn't have foreseen in your wildest dreams that Steve's malice would lead to such a monstrosity as the color purple. And now, it is upon you. Key Features Steam Leaderboards: Keep track of your rank in every level of Slip. (PC only. The Mac version does not have Steamworks support) Challenge Levels: In addition to the core game levels, there are also 20 challenge levels that really put your platforming skills to the test. Controller Support: Enjoy Slip from the couch. (PC only. Mac versions of Slip do not have controller support) Accessory Unlocks - To add a bit of silly to a light hearted game, players can also unlock clothing accessories to wear while playing. These accessories are unlocked by feats of skill while playing. The requirements can range from beating the first level to completing a level without dying. 3 Difficulty Levels - Even though Slip is immensely difficult (in a fair sort of way) players will find that their skill level increases dramatically as they master the art of color swapping. As such, there are 3 levels of play. Normal - 100% gamespeed. Hard - 110% gamespeed. And Sassy - 120% gamespeed. These percentages might not sound intimidating, but they are really quite dramatic in the context of Slip ","$0.99"

A camera might not seem like enough for a puzzle platforming adventure, but this camera is different from most:  It has the ability to capture and remove from the world the very objects that it photographs.  Not only that, but it can also use its powers to paste the photos it took back into the environment!  Everything that the camera captures is perfectly preserved, and when the photos are restored the objects are restored with it.  On top of all of that, this amazing camera can also rotate the photos before they're pasted.  Take a picture of an incoming fireball, rotate it and paste it to send it flying into a wall of heavy boxes to knock it out of the way.  See what kind of crazy things can happen to Pic with his awesome (and probably magical) camera during the adventure of his life! Key Features: A unique photography mechanic Over 100 different levels of platforming and puzzling. 4 distinct environments to explore. Secrets and time trial challenges for every level. Hand crafted high resolution graphics. ","$9.99"

This allows you to quickly create great looking animations in a fraction of the time while requiring significantly less art. Spriter also takes advantage of skeletal animation . Create a skeleton using the bone tool, attach images to each bone, and finally animate the bones with Spriter's vast array of user-friendly animation tools. The result: a fully animated sprite using your own graphics. Spriter is great for animating characters, user interfaces, power-ups, combat animations and more! Even if you've never animated before, Spriter provides you with an easy to understand, yet powerful toolset allowing you to jump right in! Spriter Pro includes the Essentials versions of all of our Animated Art Packs, free to use in any of your game projects. Once you install Spriter Pro It they will be located in the following location: /SteamApps/common/Spriter/Art Packs/Essentials Key Features: Using keyframes you can quickly lay out major frame changes. Frames in-between the keyframes are then automatically created. You can then edit individual frames as desired to make your animations really shine. Animations can be exported as spritesheets, animated GIF files, sequential images and more. Reuse your previous animations by incorporating them in new ones. Create perfect, smooth transitions and varieties that save time by working with animations you've already created. Adjust animation easing with several curve settings to help make your animations more lifelike. Create pixel perfect retro style animations with Pixel Art Mode. Spawn bullets, particle effects, or anything that requires precise locations and angles. Set up guide lines and load in background images to work on top of. Seperate characters into important collision areas. Inverse Kinematics. Change a bone's parent, add or remove bones, or even change sprite pieces mid-animation. Import sound effects and even use lip-syncing with built-in Papagayo support. Use Animation Data Directly In Your Game: Animations are recreated in real-time using the sprite piece images just like in Spriter. Animations are much smoother and require drastically less memory as compared to sprite-sheets. Manipulate animations via game events. Reuse your animation data for completely new characters or character customizations. Perfect for characters who gain new clothing, equipment etc. Spriter animations can be imported with full feature support in Unity and Construct 2.

Story Three thousand years have passed since the first colonists left Earth. Now the galaxy is divided between the militant star empires and independent mercenary groups. In a remote corner of the galaxy — Sector 1337, the area of the dead — a world has been left behind. Here, the ruins of a great civilization of Aliens have recently been discovered. Huge factories and sprawling cities are falling into decay. Fragments of ships lie on the fields where massive battles were once fought. But there is not a living soul. Everything has been destroyed by a mysterious Cataclysm — a pulsing anomaly that burned out all life within this sector. This doesn’t stop mankind, the new «owner» of the Universe. Mercenaries and adventurers have flocked to the sector to sift through the ruins and loot its abandoned artifacts, without consideration of the danger. Many have disappeared — including members of well-armed expeditions — but those who have managed to return have uncovered unprecedented riches. So looters continue to come here, to find the Aliens’ lost treasures — and to fight for them.","Free to Play"

Hernandez has been highly critical of the FBI's and Victoria's lack of progress. That does not stop Hernandez from phoning and asking Victoria to meet her later that evening.

Help a small group of settlers build a home for themselves in a forgotten land. You’ll need to establish a food supply, build shelter, defend your people, monitor their moods, and find a way to grow and expand, facing challenges at every step. Starting from procedurally generated terrain with dynamic AI encounters, Stonehearth combines community management and combat with infinite building possibilities. It’s designed to be moddable at every level, from your city to the people and creatures inhabiting the world, and will ship with the tools and documentation for you to add your own customizations to the game, and share them with friends. Build and Grow Your City The heart of the game is city building and management. When you're just starting out, you'll need to juggle tasks like obtaining a sustainable food supply, building shelter, and defending your fledgling settlement from raiders and other threats. Once you've achieved a foothold in the world, it's up to you to write the destiny for your people. You have the flexibility to choose your own path in this game. Do you want to build a great conquering empire? A vibrant trade city? A spiritual monastery? We really want you to feel like this is your settlement, and give you the tools that make it look and operate exactly as you wish. Level Up Your Settlers All the settlers in your towns have jobs. A job is like a class in a role playing game. Each job has a specific role like hauling materials, building, crafting, and fighting. As your hearthlings work at a job they will gain experience and levels. Some jobs, when they meet certain prerequisites, can upgrade to entirely new jobs with new capabilities. Usually, to assign someone a new job you'll also need to craft a tool for them. The Mason can craft blocks, statues, and tools from stone, but to do it he'll need a mallet and chisel crafted by the carpenter. Our goal is to have a job tree that's both very wide and very deep, so there will be plenty of different kinds of things to do in the game, but also a lot of depth to explore if you want to concentrate on any one area. Player Driven Legacy Through Modding We LOVE mods and want to make it as easy as possible to author and share mods. Want to see a new kind of sword in the game?

A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you! Dive Into a Vast Underwater World You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. Scavenge, Craft, and Survive After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Construct Underwater Habitats Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean. Unravel the Mystery What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive? Disrupt the Food Chain The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators. Handle the Pressure Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more. Fear the Night As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see. Dive Below the Ocean Floor Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.

									","English",NA,"Adventure,Indie,RPG"," About This Content  Many in Maj'Eyal have heard of ""demons"", sadistic creatures who appear seemingly from nowhere, leaving a trail of suffering and destruction whereever they go.  Their Fearscape floats far above the skies, watching and waiting, but not idly; their agents scout the land, their legions build up their forces, and their scholars develop new spells and strategies.  As the barrier between our worlds begins to crack under their scrutiny, helpless Eyalites have begun to disappear, whisked up to serve as their slaves and playthings.  They imbue these victims with magical powers to better survive the ensuing stresses - can you use your new-found abilities to escape the legions of Mal'Rok? Start with a new class, the Doombringer!  These avatars of demonic destruction charge into battle with massive two-handed weapons, cutting swaths of firey devastation through hordes of opponents.  Armed with flame magic and demonic strength, they delight in fighting against overwhelming odds, softening up the crowd with waves of fire, then feeding on the flames and suffering of their surroundings to stay alive while quickly reducing any group to a pile of ash and gore. Unlock a new class, the Demonologist, with an all-new item enhancement mechanic!  Bearing a shield and the magic of the Spellblaze itself, these melee-fighting casters can grow demonic seeds from their fallen enemies.  Imbue these seeds onto your items to gain a wide array of new talents and passive benefits, and summon the demons within them to fight on your side!  Ever looked at a gigantic demon-cursed minotaur and wished it was on your side for once?  Well, now you CAN summon one to pound your foes into paste while you cast devastating spells from afar, or call forth a squad of Fire Imps to pelt your enemies to death while they exhaust themselves on your impenetrable defenses!  Demons have persistent health, making them a little more precious than disposable necromancer skeletons or summoner beasts, but can be revived from death nonetheless. Two new zones, with all-new art, foes, and bosses!  You've seen the plains of the Fearscape before, now see the lairs and headquarters of the demons themselves! Over 10,000 words of written lore to find!  The demons were once an enlightened, peaceful race, hailing from a distant planet known as Mal'Rok; learn what drove them to plot Eyal's eternal torture!  Discover monuments to each of the demonic species and noteworthy individuals, showing the place of honor each has among them!  Get a glimpse into the culture and daily lives of these sadistic invaders and their brainwashed thralls! Unlock a new race, Doomelves: Shalore who've taken to the demonic alterations especially well, corrupting their typical abilities into a darker form.  Blink away to safety, transform into a shadowy dúathedlen to hide in the shadows or prey on your foes with blasts of darkness, use your new resilience to soak up status effects and critical hits, and assault your enemies' minds to leave them unsteady in combat! Between the aforementioned classes and Doomelves, a whopping 75 new talents! Unlock two new cosmetic options!  You know you've always wanted demon-horns.

The game focuses heavily on frantic platforming action complete with boss fights, spikes, and plenty of fire. Ted by Dawn follows the story of Ted Carcass, a reclusive survivor of the apocalypse. Ted is a rugged man, a man's man, a beard supporter, whiskey drinker, shotgun aficionado, and reluctant savior of the human race.  There are no checkpoints, and death instantly restarts the stage. Muscle memory, memorization, and an iron will to survive are required for success.  On a routine supply run to the local tavern, Hunter's Haven, Ted runs across a scientist. After an unfortunate skirmish with some fellow redneckians, Ted is left to escort his newly acquainted friend across the wasteland to find a suitable laboratory to synthesize a cure for the horrible mutagen that has ravaged the land. Along the way, Ted will meet with hordes of zombies, mutants, savage survivors, and apparently, flaming pants.",""

Replay the campaign with your victorious squad in a New Game+ mode The Templar Knights are a revered and storied martial order who were the elite forces for the Star Traders during their most challenging conflict: the Galactic War against the Guild. Their unchallenged prowess derives from two key factors: Leviathan Battle Suits - They pilot 10 foot tall battle mechs known as Leviathan Battle Suits. Once designed for high-pressure environments and exploring gas giants and deep space, these mechs have been adapted for war. Templar Lineage - Templars descend from a Zendu bloodline -- a unique heritage that gives them the ability (with proper training and ritual) to pass all of memories from their lives (and any memories passed down by their ancestors) to a newly born child. This memory gift is known as a Templar’s Lineage – and it is what gives Templars their immense advantage in combat, tactics, engineering, and the ability to drive the hulking Leviathan Battle Suits. The player takes on the role of a Templar Captain who hails from a storied Lineage reaching back 87 Templars -- and who pages back through the memories to help cope with the dire situation at hand. The Templar Knights are a martial order sworn to protect the Star Traders – the last known free humans. Under the guidance of the Templars and the prophet Shalun, the Star Traders departed the ruins of the Galactic Core, leaving behind desolation wrought by the great Galactic War. Guided by the prophet, the Star Traders sought a new home among the stars. Across the multi-generational journey of the Great Exodus, many ships have been lost, fallen behind, or splintered from the main fleet -- scattering the Star Traders to the galactic winds. With the Great Exodus coming to an end, the Star Traders founded new colonies on the few remaining habitable worlds. The Templar Knights are called upon once again to defend the Star Traders and their new colonies from an ancient threat. Templar Battleforce is the fourth Trese Brothers title set in the Star Traders universe. The game follows Templar Assault, the Trese Brothers’ original squad-based warfare game in which players lead squads of Templar Knights against the Xeno threat. Templar Battleforce inherits not only the rich story of its predecessor, but the game’s high tension and corridor-to-corridor combat style. Games created by the Trese Brothers are known for challenging difficulty progressions, so you’ll have the option to play on easy and normal difficulties -- or crank it up into multiple gears of insanely challenging combat! Trese Brothers Games is one of the premier indie game development studios for desktop and mobile RPG and strategy games. Andrew and Cory Trese founded Trese Brothers Games in 2010 from a shared passion for challenging, highly replayable games. With more than six games on major game platforms and markets, Trese Brothers Games has more than 2.5 million customers . . . and counting. Come join the family!

Set at a skyscraper construction site, the game’s goal is to climb ever higher and higher. The game is all about physics and interaction with the environment. Character Mr. Bobley is just your average construction worker who arrives to work in the morning only to find intricate puzzles to solve. He has to prove his skills in a hazardous construction site environment. To advance in the game he has to figure out how to use various kinds of construction machinery to his advantage. Game mechanics While the game looks almost like a 2d platformer, the character can walk in any direction. The camera view is locked overlooking the scene at a constant angle. Even when driving vehicles the camera angle remains unchanged. To aid the player in orienting themselves in 3d space, small graphical help is provided in the form of a jump distance indicator and a picture-in-picture window. Levels There are 24 levels in the game. Each level has several puzzles that you need to solve in order to advance to the next puzzle. Level design can be quite complex because there are usually multiple floors in one level. Higher floors become transparent to prevent blocking the player’s view. Nonetheless, the player always knows where to go because the exit is always to the right and upwards. This is yet another game mechanic taken from classic platformer games. Puzzles All puzzles are based on physics interaction with the environment. You have to drive cars, trucks, fork-lifts and tipping lorries. Use cranes and elevators to push, haul, lift and transport objects as necessary to overcome challenges and get obstacles out of the way. You also need to build bridges and make stairways. There are also various minigames like maze puzzle, escape run, even a soccer match. ","$3.99"

If you've been following it or playing it in Early Access, you know what to expect. If you've just discovered it, ""stay awhile and listen"". The most commonly asked question is: What Kind of Game Is It? It’s a very different game than anything you’ve ever played. I’m sure you’ve noticed that the RPG genre hasn’t really been explored yet and most RPGs follow the formula that didn’t change in 20 years. While there were always games that strayed off the beaten path – Darklands, Planescape: Torment, King of Dragon Pass – such games were the exceptions that only reinforced the rule. The Age of Decadence is an experiment, an attempt to explore a different direction, taking you back to the PnP roots of the genre. It doesn’t mean that the game is awesome. In fact, there is a good chance that you won’t like it, precisely because we took too many liberties with the established design. So What Sets The Age of Decadence Apart From Other Games? 1. The Setup Traditionally, many fantasy RPGs are about killing things, clearing up dungeons, and being a hero. There is nothing wrong with mindless fun and wish fulfillment, but we want to offer you something different. To quote Tom Chick (Quarter to Three's game critic): ""But Age of Decadence wants nothing to do with kobolds, just as it wants nothing to do with Doo-dads of Unimaginable Power. The overarching idea is a crumbling society divided among three noble Houses, each fumbling around in its own version of darkness to comprehend what destroyed the world. That’s the central mystery. It plays out like noir in that you are the detective, piecing together what really happened from differing accounts, all vividly written with clear voices and efficient prose. And like a detective in a noir yarn, you can’t help but become part of the central mystery, effecting an outcome you might not have intended."" The Age of Decadence is not a game about killing monsters or exploring mystical lands, but rather, surviving amid the greed and brutality of your fellow humans and carving out a name for yourself. Good and bad are purely relative. It’s a world of scheming and backstabbing in which your words and actions have the potential to forge alliances and sow discord, and your path is never certain. You get to play with seven different factions: three Noble Houses and four 'professional' guilds: merchants, assassins, thieves, and the army, all fighting for power or influence; over 100 named characters, over 750 ‘generic’ characters with unique IDs taking part in violent take-overs, assassinations, and power grabs, and over 600,000 words of dialogue: a well-developed and thought through world, believable characters, realistic motivations, but no elves, dwarves, magic, and wizards in fashionable, pointy hats. 2. Combat difficulty Another design aspect worth mentioning is combat difficulty. It’s a hard game. Combat difficulty is integrated into the setting. You can’t say that the world is harsh and unforgiving and then let the player kill everyone who looks at him or her funny. The game has to be hard, dying should be easy, and you should have reasons to pick your fights. You aren’t a powerful hero who can defeat anyone and save the world and it is the difficulty that reinforces this notion. Make the game easier and we’re back to the powerful hero setup. So unless you’re a natural born killer, watch what you say and think before you act or you’ll end up dead before you can blink. 3. Choices & Consequences Choices are what the game is all about - crafting your own narrative via a variety of choices that alter the story, playing field, and your options down the road. From multiple quest solutions to branching questlines you'll have plenty decisions to make and consequences of said decisions to deal with, which is what makes the game incredibly replayable. Starting the game as a mercenary and joining the Imperial Guards will give a completely different experience, different quests, different content and points of view than, say, playing the game as a merchant (less buying low and selling high, more scheming and plotting to gain advantages for the guild), a praetor serving a Noble House, or an assassin. The questlines are interwoven, forming a large, overarching story, so playing the game only once will be like witnessing events from a single perspective, which is limited by default. You will have to play the game several times to better understand what’s going on, piece everything together, and see the full effect of the choices you make. The Big Question: Should You Buy The Game? Try before you buy. Even if everything I said sounds exactly like your kind of game, try the demo first. That’s what it’s there for. It gives you access to the first Chapter, consisting of 3 locations and about 30 quests split between mutually exclusive questlines and decisions.","$14.99"

Constructed by an unmanned research vessel sent from Earth, the Lun Infinus station was designed to run simulations for a five year period, exploring possibilities of human colonization in the case that Earth became uninhabitable. Developed during an age of ambition and wealth, the project was quickly abandoned when interest faded in the following years. The last transmission from Earth occurred more than thirty years ago. The Lun Infinus station contained five sentient computers, Derelicts, built with certain levels of mobility in the case of emergency or need for relocation. Each of these Derelicts was to formulate their own plan for colonization based on thousands of hours of simulations. Given the amount of time that has passed however, the simulations have become very elaborate and bizarre. Meanwhile however, a mysterious computer virus has emerged. The virus of unknown origins has been slowly ravaging the Derelicts. Because of this, more and more CPU processing power has been needed for anti-virus measures, leaving less power for the simulations. Coffee is the last mobile resident of the station, a small service robot who spends his days keeping the station and the Derelicts operational as they perform their daily tasks. Since CPU power is slim, Coffee has been cutting corners to find ways around the virus. By using small subsystems and less vital CPU's scattered through the station in lesser devices, Coffee has designed a line of digital helpers, each simply called a D-Co, or ""Digital Counterpart"", to assist him in fighting the virus and keeping the station operational. Eventually the virus gets the best of each D-Co, and Coffee tries to create an improved D-Co using a different CPU. The latest is D-Co 9, built using the code of a simple computer game. Coffee dedicates his own CPU to be used for the main simulations, putting D-Co in charge of moving his body throughout the station, taking care of the needs of the Derelicts, and fighting off virus attacks when they occur. GAMEPLAY: The Desolate Hope mixes several gameplay styles. On the station and in the simulations, the game is a platformer. You will shoot enemies, collect powerups and bits (money) and upgrade yourself and your virtual battlers. When you enter a mini-simulation (the old arcade style screens) then the game becomes an 8-bit overhead dungeon crawler. There you can farm money and gain options to customize your battle experiences. When you encounter a virus boss, the game shifts to a JRPG style battle where you must use the mouse to select from your various options to defeat your opponent. Almost everything outside of these battles is aimed at upgrading your abilities and increasing your stats for these fights, they are the real challenge of the game. ""The Desolate Hope, isn't great just because of its stunning artwork, its gripping sci-fi story, and its coffee pot protagonist. It also packs a triple punch with three distinct gameplay types, each skillfully woven together. The side scrolling action has different platforming elements for each section, the overhead adventure distills fun elements of a classic Zelda (including walls you can walk through or destroy) and the turn-based, RPG-style boss battles are visually mesmerizing and tough."" -IndieGames.com ""From a gameplay point of view The Desolate Hope mixes platforming with overhead adventure segments and semi turn-based battles. This is already intriguing, but I'm more impressed by its stunning visual style."" -mtv.com ""The Desolate Hope is developed by Scott Games and upon booting it up, you will notice the great artwork the game uses. It combines three gameplay genres, side scrolling, overhead adventure and a turn-based RPG styled battles. It might sound like a messy mash up but the game is able to pull it off without a hitch and gamers are in for a unique experience. Offering hours of gameplay, a unique leveling system and a day-and-night cycle."" -TheBitBag.com ""The Desolate Hope constantly plays with the very idea of playing a video game. Unlike many modern games, it is hyper-aware of its gameness. There are games inside of games, simulations inside of simulations, mini-games inside of boss fights. And the fact that you’re playing as an AI that developed from a computer game is a very hard wink at the exhaustive level of metagaming that’s going on."" -GamesThatExist.com ""There are plenty of hours of gameplay, a nonlinear path allowing for exploration, and detailed art design. Now you can't beat that..."" -GameSpot.com ""I very much enjoy a lot about this game; it’s takes on platforming, dungeon-crawling, and RPGs is unique and well mixed together so that one type of play benefits the other. It also has some incredible visuals, with very detailed character designs and a classic cyberpunk attitude, but not also without a bit of whimsy as well (one derelict has given up on his mission, becoming a toymaker and has begun recreating his simulation with child-like automatons)."" -GamingSymmetry.com ""So after encountering this on Rock Paper Shotgun, I was ready to declare my indie game of the year. Because any game made rock solid out of derelict, insane robots just makes my not-so-inner geek squeal. How insane are the robots? Each is actively running a matrix like test bed, and.... Well, one was building a mining simulator, decided that was too depressing, and started making toys. Another is trying to capture the artistic essence of the soul, but cant seem to make anything run for more than five seconds. The next is attempting to rebuild humanity out of two tissue samples. Then there's the one still running straight, he seems curiously nice... And the last one's dead and frozen. But still drawing power...Then there's the coffee pot. Which is you. Sort of. And hey, bonus! You've got fifteen days to live, and you're the ninth attempt at straightening things out. Good luck!"" -an enthusiastic fan ",""

About The Expendables 3 In THE EXPENDABLES 3, Barney (Stallone), Christmas (Statham) and the rest of the team come face-to-face with Conrad Stonebanks (Gibson), who years ago co-founded The Expendables with Barney. Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill… or so he thought. Stonebanks, who eluded death once before, now is making it his mission to end The Expendables -- but Barney has other plans. Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. The latest mission becomes a clash of classic old-school style versus high-tech expertise in the Expendables’ most personal battle yet. Lionsgate and Millennium Films present a Nu Image production. PG-13 for violence including intense sustained gun battles and fight scenes, and for language.","Free"

The goal of the game is to defend Great Britain against German bombing raids.  The game has two distinct gameplay experiences where: * The player manages war production and squadron placement * The player organizes patrol routes and tactics  Once combat is initiated the player can lead their squadrons to attack waves of German bombers utilizing simple touch or mouse commands.  The game follows the historical timeline very closely, but at the same time - the game mechanics are easy to learn (yet hard to master) and it provides great entertainment for both seasoned and novice players.  * There are 8 aircraft types in the game - including of course the famous Supermarine Spitfire! * Every pilot is earning his own experience - witness your rookies become aces! * Manage the British war machine - decide what should be built and where * Fight epic air battles! * Lead English, Polish, Czechs, Canadian and New Zealands squadrons to fight for freedom!  The game implements ‘German Command AI” which results in each campaign playing out differently. No two games will ever be the same.","$7.99"

So the incredible adventures continue, and Van Helsing, the famous monster-hunter returns to save the day again with the help of his charming, ghostly companion, Lady Katarina. The gothic metropolis of weird science is on the brink of destruction as chaos rules the streets and a new enemy plots revenge. It’s time to enter the dark side of Borgova and the forbidden wilderness, but beware: you are not the only one behind a mask. Main features Three playable classes – In the sequel to this gothic-noir adventure, you can choose from three very different classes: the classic Hunter with shooting and melee skills, the magic-wielding Thaumaturge or the Arcane Mechanic, the master of deadly devices, all included in the base game. Hunter’s Lair – The Lair returns in the sequel as your perfect hideout to stash collected loot, trade with non-playable characters, teleport between locations, forge new items, utilize the alchemy lab and accept new quests from allies who join the Resistance against the scientific scourge. Extended Tower defense mini-game – With enemies invading in waves, you have the opportunity to defend your Lair and other strategic locations with deployable traps and several upgradable functions to ward off evil, now with improved gameplay mechanics and up to 7 levels presented as optional side quests. Resistance Management – As the leader of the Borgovian Resistance, you will participate in the micromanagement of the allied troops, improve the equipment of the Resistance fighters or find loot that makes them more powerful. Rage system – You can charge up to three skill modifiers called PowerUps on 8 active skills by way of spending Rage points collected from impressive feats. Unique companion – Lady Katarina, a ghost with snappy wit, comes to the support of Van Helsing with her own set of abilities, behaviors, and two skill trees. Runecrafting – Besides forging, enchanting and infusing items with essences, you’ll have another option to alter items to your liking. Artifacts can be taken apart, shattered into magical fragments to be turned into purely magical runes that can be altered and put on new items, changing them into various new powerful artifacts. The Beast in the Lair - The Chimera is a unique creature, an artificial monster straight from the Ink. You can enhance its abilities and summon it into combat or send away to the Ink to hunt for treasure. Hall of Trophies - You can decorate the Lair with trophies that give global modifiers to the game world, like empowering monsters, granting more spellpower to all allies or turning Katarina into a more lethal ghost. Multiplayer – You and your friends can test your skills against each other via the PVP mode (8 players) or join forces and complete the story in the co-operative campaign (4 players). ","$14.99"

The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meagre supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls ""the pinnacle of an entire genre"". The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes two of the five episodes that form its Season One. Both episodes were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - “Do Not Go Gentle” Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - “Luminance Fugue” Mackenzie’s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted?

Unlike other stealth games though, there’s no time for waiting in the shadows until the right moment! Wandering guards decide their patrol routes on the fly, security cameras keep watch over everything and even innocent gallery goers just visiting to admire the art might raise the alarm if they see something suspicious.

Game features Organised Chaos – More than your typical stealth game, The Marvellous Miss Take is a fluid, high-speed game of cat and mouse! Random guard patterns require players to think on their feet rather than hiding in the shadows, and one false move means escape can be snatched away from you in seconds. Wits, Not Fists – Forget violence, takedowns or picking off guards one by one… distraction's the key to success here! Each stage stays tense from the first step to the last, so put your gadgets to good use to keep out of trouble and pilfer everything you can before someone spots you! The Bigger Picture – Sneak into the 25 multi-floored galleries as one of three different characters, each of which has their own unique skills and goals.

As you piece these fragments together, a story of guilt, loneliness, and faith begins to take shape.  And it becomes increasingly obvious that something is hunting you... The Moon Sliver is best thought of as an experiment in exploration-focused storytelling, blurring the line between novelette and game.

And it needs to be broken. There is one goal. And when you attain it, you die.  Six sisters live in an apartment in the city. One by one their mother sends them on an errand to their grandmother, who is sick and bedridden. The teenagers are instructed to go to grandmother's house deep in the forest and, by all means, to stay on the path! Wolves are hiding in the woods, just waiting for little girls to stray. But young women are not exactly known for their obedience, are they? Will they be able to resist the temptations of the forest? Will they stay clear of danger? Can they prevent the ancient tale from being retold?  The Path is a game about growing, about changing, about making choices, about accepting the consequences of these choices. A game about playing, and failing, about embracing life, perhaps by accepting death. Key Features: The Path is a short horror game inspired by older versions of Little Red Riding hood , set in modern day. The Path offers an atmospheric experience of exploration, discovery and introspection through a unique form of gameplay, designed to immerse you deeply into its dark themes. Every interaction in the game expresses an aspect of the narrative. The six protagonists each have their own age and personality and allow the player to live through the tale in different ways. Most of the story, however, relies on your active imagination. The Path is designed with accessibility in mind. There are no ticking clocks or monsters to defeat. No hard puzzles will ever halt your progress. Most activities in the game are entirely optional and voluntary. The player has all the freedom in the world to explore and experience.  While The Path does not contain any graphic violence or sexuality, it does allude to these themes. The overall melancholy mood of the game and the potentially unsettling course of events, make The Path unsuitable for children . Despite of its origins in fairy tales, The Path is decidedly a game for the mature mind. The game features a complete realtime 3D environment that can be explored through third person navigation. The characters in this virtual world, including the player's avatars, are governed by a form of artificial intelligence that gives them some autonomy. As a result, nobody knows exactly what you will encounter on your journeys. Next to the multi-layered stylized graphics, The Path features a continuous soundtrack composed by goth rock diva Jarboe (ex-Swans). In fact, there are hardly any sound effects in the game. Instead the music is continuously changing according to what is happening in the game. Like the behaviours of the characters, the music too is never exactly the same twice. For a satisfying experience, it takes about 6 hours to complete the game.","$9.99"

Want to participate in Closed Alpha and Beta Tests of The Universim? Subscribe to the Newsletter and we’ll let you know when the CBT begins! WANNA BE A GOD? Your time is coming. Guide a fledgling civilization through the obstacles of life. From humble beginnings, watch as they evolve and advance throughout the ages under your wing. Influence their decisions and punish the unfaithful with a wide range of godly abilities. Interact with objects, create disasters, and launch clueless creatures into orbit. This is your world, and nothing can stop you from having fun. Our goal is to bring back the features you know and love from classic god games and spice them up with fresh ideas, a modern physics engine, and stylized visuals developed by a few of our very own industry heroes. THE STORY OF A SPECIES Meet the Nuggets, a fragile and whacky species that relies on your leadership to build, research, and advance. Help them, and they will soon begin writing their own history in the stars. Every Nugget is a unique individual with a distinct set of characteristics. Just like any other living creature, Nuggets must have access to a few vital resources in order to survive. This includes water to drink, food to eat, and recreational activities to increase their happiness and quality of life. Recreational activities may include blowing stuff up. You’ve been warned. As you spend time with the Nuggets, You will see that they behave like natural, living beings. They have their own thoughts and needs - and they even have the ability to make their own decisions at times. We want to give you a feeling that you’re interacting with a living organism, almost like you’re messing around with a rather chaotic ant farm. ORGANIC GAMEPLAY Planets in The Universim aren’t just made up of a bunch of neatly-arranged objects; everything is linked together and plays a unique role in each planet’s ecosystem. Every tree your civilization cuts down, every resource they mine and every animal they hunt will affect the world they’re living in. A lack of trees and high levels of pollution will raise the global temperature over time, while reckless hunting or fishing might cause the extinction of some species. It’s your mission to manage how the Nuggets collect and utilize resources. What mark will you leave on the ecosystems that existed millions of years before your arrival? Will you use every available resource and expand at an unprecedented pace, or will you methodically create a more sustainable way of life for your civilization? These are living, breathing worlds where everything is interconnected. We aim to provide you with an unique experience unlike any of the god games you have played before. Every decision you or your civilization makes will have consequences. NATURE AS YOU KNOW IT In The Universim, nature is just as wonderful and unpredictable as ever. Every planet comes with a few surprises that are sure to challenge your civilization. From tornadoes that consume everything in their path, to thunderous earthquakes that threaten to split your civilization in two. If you treat nature poorly, it might just show you how brutal and unforgiving it can be. Each planet you encounter will have a unique underbelly. Some planets are tranquil and filled to the brim with resources, while others are barren and dangerous. Be careful out there! Something as simple as the cycle between night and day can play an important role. Wild animal attacks are more common at night, as are frequent temperature drops. Daytime offers a little more safety from the harshness of the world. With the inclusion of a full, four-season cycle, a planet’s biomes can change drastically, making it extremely difficult for Nuggets to survive brutal winters without proper preparation ahead of time.

Please see this link for details. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person story-driven mystery game that focuses entirely on exploration and discovery. It contains no combat or explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you won’t be able to see them. You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethan’s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into. Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters. Still, the discoveries won’t happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Paul’s supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy. Key Features Explore and interact with the beautiful yet ominous world of Red Creek Valley , which was created with the use of revolutionary photogrammetry technology that allows for nearly photorealistic environments. Communicate with the dead and see how they died in order to gather clues that help you piece together the truth behind Ethan’s disappearance -- and the fate of his family. Experience, in non-linear fashion, a story that combines the pleasures of pulp, private eye, and horror fiction , all of it inspired by writers such as Raymond Chandler, Algernon Blackwood, Stefan Grabinski, and H. P. Lovecraft. Conduct the investigation on your own terms and at your own pace . Although there are a few scary bits in the game, players will have no need for sedatives. Our game is less about terror and more about clammy unease. ","$19.99"

Ravenous, monstrous Brothers beckon the soul to preserve every bit of it; enticing, sly Sisters beg to be fed. The whole Void, inhabited also by a multitude of weird and sometimes scary creatures, changes with every droplet of Color used, making every action you take have repercussions across the whole world. But perhaps there is another way to use the Color. The way to break out of the never-ending cycle of the Void. Nourishing Color in gardens and fighting the Void’s creatures, unlocking the Sisters’ hearts and taking on their Brothers, the player gets the chance to find it… and achieve ultimate transcendence. Explore the Void. Broken into 29 separate chambers, the place you have fallen into is full of secrets, twists, and turns. Nourish, hunt, mine. Each type of environment offers its own features: grow Color in some, hunt for it or mine it in others, unlocking new chambers through the Sisters. Draw your soul. All important actions in the game are executed through drawing on the screen, the effect depending both on the sigil drawn and the color used. Get to know the Sisters. Each of them representing a combination of two Colors, each of them alluring and greedy, the Sisters are willing to spill their hearts out—if you fill them with Color first. Obey… or disobey. Seeing you as one of their own, the grotesque Brothers are willing to share their wisdom—as long as you obey. And if you don’t, be prepared for hard fights with intimidating gigantic foes. Gaze long into the Void and feel it gaze into you. The only resource in the game, Color changes both you and the world around you with every droplet used. Accumulating Red inside your heart can make you strong, but it also makes predators more aggressive; find the perfect balance or just watch the world react to every choice of yours. Listen to the Voice of Color and find your true purpose. ","$9.99"

In thirty short minutes, the game leaves it up to you to figure out every part of its increasingly bizarre universe, in order to survive the onslaught of unexpected creatures and ultimately comprehend their true nature. No matter how your descent to the bottom of the forest takes shape, it is guaranteed to give you the chills without a single word of dialog. Keep your eyes open, for there is darkness beneath the surface. And you're not at the bottom yet.

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine: Anniversary Edition It's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? This War of Mine: Inspired by real-life events Control your survivors and manage your shelter Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme IGN This War of Mine might be the war game we need. Gamespot I was intrigued by This War of Mine's attempts to portray the consequences of war in a way that games have largely ignored in the past. The fact that the psychological and emotional challenges of living under such horrifying conditions are something you have to consider as you struggle gives me added hope that it might treat its hefty and important subject matter with the gravity and complexity that it deserves.

The game is brimming over with riffs and variants on that core mechanic with 20 game modes, dozens of special blocks and items, and 115 levels in the adventure mode alone. The basic rules of the game are this: blocks fall down into the board and have a color and an arrow direction. If a stack of blocks exceeds the height of the board, you lose. In order to clear blocks, you must right-click and drag paths through the arrows to set up chain reactions of like-colored blocks. If this sounds simple, that's because it is -- you'll be lining up lengthy chains within minutes. But you'll be surprised how much brainpower it takes to set up combos of multiple chains, and the many brainteaser-style puzzles include some real stumpers. Tidalis has co-op and competitive multiplayer modes (both online and offline); action-oriented modes and timer-less brainteasers; a lengthy, casual-friendly adventure mode; twenty unique game modes providing innumerable twists to the basic gameplay; dozens of special blocks and items; and over fifty minutes of beautiful music to go with the painterly art. In short, several games' worth of content are built on top of this core mechanic, which you'll quickly find to be as iconic as it is novel. Key Features:  Puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new mechanic.  Two-player co-op and competitive play (both local and networked).  A wide selection of both action-oriented or brainteaser-like levels.

The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fuelled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other. Story / Background In the distant future, the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core (a contraction of ""Consciousness Repository""). The Core's technological and economic triumphs have allowed humanity to colonize most of the Milky Way and enjoy peace and prosperity. However, the balance is broken by a technological breakthrough that allows the consciousness of a human being to be reliably transferred into a machine, thereby theoretically granting infinite life, in a process called ""patterning."" Following a mandate imposed on humanity by the Core requiring everyone to undergo patterning as a public health measure, a rebel band is formed out of colonies from the edges of the galaxy (hence their name, the Arm), whose members refused to leave their natural bodies to join the Core's machines. A war lasting 4,000 years followed, with the Arm mass-producing clones as pilots for its vehicles and the Core duplicating consciousness-embedded microchips to pilot its own machines. Key information Total Annihilation (TA) is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game created by Cavedog Entertainment under the guidance of lead designer Chris Taylor. It was released on September 30, 1997, and was the first RTS game to feature 3D units and terrain. Two expansion packs were released: The Core Contingency on April 30, 1998, and Battle Tactics exactly 2 months later on June 30, 1998. When TA was released, the minimum computer requirements were a Pentium 100 MHz processor and 16 MB of RAM. Of course, these requirements were for computers in 1997; modern day machines easily exceed those recommended specifications, but it is still recommended to have a 1 GHz processor and 512 MB of RAM for the updated game engine. Game features Upon release, the original TA game boasted: Fully-articulated 3D units and buildings, with a diverse complement of unit types — for example, aircraft, amphibious tanks, infantry bots (kbots), vehicles, hovercraft, ships, submarines, unit production factories, powerful stationary defenses, and long-range weapons. A unique tracking feature allows players to follow single units, entire armies, or even projectiles across the landscape.  True 3D terrain that units can climb over, into, and around, on extra-large 3D-generated maps. TA runs comfortably in high resolutions and even on modern dual monitor setups, so players can see more of the battlefield.  Numerous world types to do battle on, such as grasslands, forests, deserts, archipelagos, open water, lava, metal, ice, crystal, acid, and even moons.  More than 150 official units and 25 official missions per side in a single player campaign. The Core Contingency expansion pack added 75 new units (including the infamous Krogoth), 50 new maps, 25 new missions, and 6 new world types. Battle Tactics added 4 new units, 6 new maps, and 100 new missions. A final patch (version 3.1c, and included here) added 6 new units, including a resurrection kbot!  Detailed and exciting campaigns that focus on their respective side's leaders, the Commanders. The stories of either the Core or the Arm start with an effort to defend the protagonist's home world and initiate a turning point in the war, followed by a series of battles on numerous planets and moons (using Galactic Gates as a form of faster-than-light transportation), before a final strike on the enemy's home world: either on the Arm's bucolic Empyrean or the Core's artificial Jupiter Brain world of Core Prime. Mission objectives include protecting a vital structure or area, capturing a pivotal enemy unit, or simply eliminating all enemy units. More powerful units and weapons are gradually unlocked throughout the campaigns after specific missions or events.  Single-player skirmish battles and full multiplayer support, allowing players to watch and join battles, and form allied teams to share resources, information, and units.  Highly advanced weaponry, including lasers, energy machine guns (EMGs), starburst missiles, plasma shells, lightning pulses, paralyzers, and nuclear warheads.  Variables such as gravity, tides, and wind to disrupt the effectiveness of certain weapon types or to enhance resource production.  Intelligence measures to detect or jam enemy units using radar and sonar, the ability to cloak or provide stealth shielding for units, and the means to revive destroyed units from their wreckages.  Over the years, the TA community has created literally thousands of third-party units and hundreds of maps to customize a player's TA experience. Numerous utilities, missions, mods, and factions have also been created to rebalance or totally convert the game; many of these units are still in competitive online and skirmish play today. Modern modifications to the game push the venerable 16-year-old TA engine to new limits with complex scripting, allowing for mass unit transporting, instant map-wide teleportation, upgradeable units, and true shields — plus much more. Don't forget to visit File Universe and Unit Universe to download and test the TA community's many maps, missions, mods, races, standalone units, utilities, and other extras! More information You can find more detailed information about the many aspects of TA — including the perfect installation, troubleshooting techniques, and tutorials on how to use / create third-party mods, units, maps, and missions — in TA FAQ . Further reading — about the gameplay, story, Jeremy Soule's eponymous soundtrack, reception, and the 58 awards that TA received — can be found by visiting the TA article on Wikipedia.

Town of Salem is a fresh innovation on the classic party games Mafia and Werewolf. It is a game of murder, accusations, deceit and mob hysteria. How To Play  The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught. Roles Town of Salem has 33 unique roles ensuring a different experience each time you play. Before a game starts, players are put into a lobby where the host can select what roles will be in the game. Players are then assigned roles at random from the list of chosen roles. Players have an in-game role card that explains their role's abilities and alignments. For an in-depth look at the abilities of each role please visit: www.blankmediagames.com/roles Game Phases Night The night phase is when most roles use their abilities. For example, Serial Killers stealthily murder people, Doctors heal people who are attacked, and Sheriffs interrogate people for suspicious activity. Day The day phase allows the Town members to discuss who they suspect of being an evil role. Once the voting phase starts a majority vote from the town will put someone on trial. Defense The defense phase is when you plead your innocence to the town. Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows! Judgement During this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes the defendant is sentenced to death by hanging! Customization Players are able to choose their own map (town setting), character, pet, lobby icon, death animation, house and a custom name. The other players in the game will see your selections. There are currently 10 maps, 29 characters, 20 pets, 5 death animations and 20 houses to choose from. Achievements There are currently over 220 unique achievements in the game. Earning achievements will grant various in-game items (however the items for donation rewards are exclusive to Kickstarter).","$4.99"

That makes the economy. 21 Class combinations World best warrior in the realm, legendary master, 5-star chef… You don’t really know which one fits you?

Even monsters will envy you, thus please keep calm and don’t panic, even though they begin the war to take your territory. This would be a superb chance to be the best knight in the ToL world!

"Universal Combat CE","app","The ultimate space capital ship combat compendium is the evolution of hard core space combat sims. The only game of its kind currently in existence.","Feb 6, 2015","3000AD","3000AD,3000AD","Strategy,Simulation,Action,Space,Indie,Sci-fi,Space Sim","Single-player,Partial Controller Support","English",NA,"Action,Indie,Simulation,Strategy"," About This Game  THE MOST ADVANCED SPACE COMBAT CAPITAL SHIP SIMULATOR. EVER. SERIOUSLY. In Feb 2015, as part of the Battlecruiser twenty-five year anniversary celebration, a refresh of Universal Combat v2.0 was released for FREE for a limited time. Universal Combat which was first released in 2004, was the spiritual successor to the legendary Battlecruiser 3000AD series of games which made its debut in 1996. Then heralded as the most advanced capital ship space combat game, Battlecruiser 3000AD, the first title in the series, set the resulting standard for high-end capital ship combat games. You not only had control over a massive armed carrier in a vast universe with space and planetary bodies, you also had complete control over the carrier’s systems (weapons, navigation etc), support crafts (fighters, shuttles, vehicles) as well as an entire crew that moved around the ship doing various things (e.g. engaging in combat with intruders). When Universal Combat arrived, aside from new graphics technologies, it brought along with it a host of new features which were not present in the previous Battlecruiser titles. Such features included advanced fps controls which allowed you to not only deploy your carrier crew to planets, control them in combat etc, but it also allowed you to fight alongside them In 2007, Universal Combat Collectors Edition was released as the final title in the Battlecruiser and Universal Combat IPs. In 2009, following the 2008 release of Galactic Command Echo Squad SE which had improved space and planetary engines, we again refreshed the Universal Combat CE game with those improved engines, then later released it as Universal Combat Collector’s Edition v2.0. This ultimate space capital ship combat compendium spans over two decades and represents the evolution of hard core space combat sims. It contains all Commander scenarios from every game in the Battlecruiser and Universal Combat series: Universal Combat Special Edition (3000AD, Oct 2006) Universal Combat A World Apart (3000AD, Oct 2005) Universal Combat Gold (3000AD, Oct 2005) Universal Combat (Dreamcatcher Interactive, Feb 2004) Battlecruiser Millennium Gold (Dreamcatcher Interactive, March 2003) Battlecruiser Millennium (EB Games Exclusive, Nov 2001) Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0 (Interplay, Dec 1998) Battlecruiser 3000AD (Take2, Sept. 1996) PRIMARY GAMEPLAY FEATURES Here is a sampling of the game features, out of hundreds of things that you can do in the game; most of which you can must make up as you go along. And this list doesn't contain any mention of the advanced game engine technologies, especially one of the most advanced AI systems you've ever encountered in a game. Command 28 capital ships including carriers, cruisers, transports. Command 46 support crafts including fighters, shuttles and planetary vehicles. Command a crew of over 100 personnel including key personnel such a Flight Officer, Navigation Officer etc. Use fleet command & control to create a massive fleet consisting of your ships and other AI controlled ones. Direct control of various ship systems including shields, reactor, engine, cloaking, tractor beam, transporters and various advanced weapon systems. Track your ship's AI crew as they go about their on-board duties which include engaging hostile intruders, repairing ship systems, prepping support craft etc. Lead your marines into battle on planets using various weapons of mass destruction. Deploy an away team of (e.g. marines, engineers etc) in a shuttle, deploy them on various planetside missions; complete with advanced orders. Deploy probes to keep track of friendly regions as well as spy on hostile ones. Deploy mining drones on planets to mine for precious minerals which you can then sell for profit. Dock at various space stations and planetary bases to trade, repair, rearm - and of course engage the hostile ones along the way. Capture space stations for your alliance and use them as operational bases, including the ability to use their own fleet of support craft (cruisers, carriers, fighters etc) Play the freeform scenario and roam a large persistent galaxy . No shuttles? Don't want to risk being shot down? Use the transporter room to deploy your combat away team directly into hostile planets. MULTIPLAYER There is no multiplayer in this version of the game. SUPPORT There are no more updates to the base game. The final version was v2.00.03 released on 05-28-2015. You can view the 2.0 changelog for more info. Due to the game being improved upon, future updates are only released via The Lyrius Conflict DLC which uses v3.x game engine kernel.

Velvet Sundown is a social multiplayer role-playing game, taking place on a luxury yacht cruising the waters of a fictitious Caribbean state of Balbonia. Embark on a journey full of conspiracies, trickery and secrets where you can never tell a friend from foe. In the beginning of each game you are assigned one of the 11 readymade characters at random. Each character has their own unique agenda to pursue, as well as a randomized goal to strive for. Fulfilling your objectives might not be as easy as it seems though: as everyone else has their own secrets, some of the people aboard might not be as willing to co-operate as you would like. It is up to you to use your cunning, wits and social skills to get what you want and avoid spilling your own secrets. The scenarios are always multiplayer and require a minimum of 4 players, which means that every character you see is played by a real person. This also means completing quests always requires freeform chatting and interaction with the other characters. Velvet Sundown is based on the Dramagame engine developed by the Finnish game developer Tribe Studios Ltd. Key Features The first entertainment title ever to use revolutionary Dramagame mechanics and technology Endless replayability: players' actions affect how each scenario plays out, so every session is truly unique Uses high-quality text-to-speech technology by Acapela to enhance immersion No grinding, no killing, no looting – just 100% pure role-playing ","Free To Play"

During your year long solo mission you begin to question the world around you. The game reacts in subtle ways to how you play. Aboard Verde Station, you will test your wits, question everything, and strain to keep your sanity. Welcome to solitude. It is highly recommended that if you like games that aim to surprise you and keep you questioning what's happening, do not read much about the game. The less you know the better experience you'll have. You can only play it for the first time once. Gameplay: Verde Station is a game of small details, many of which can easily be missed. It can be considered a mystery box game, walking simulator, exploration game, or story game. At its core, Verde Station is an interactive exploration game that lightly reacts to how you play it. Examine every detail of the station, pick up and view items, and dig into computer terminals. You will uncover clues about the station and have to decide if you can trust what you see and hear. As the answers come, so do more questions. Key Features: Reactive Storytelling: The core story of Verde Station is fixed but depending on how you interact with the game you will have a slightly different experience. The world around you reacts to the type of player you are. These are subtle changes specifically designed to match your personality. They are also specifically designed so you won't notice most of them until a second or third play-through. Interactive Exploration: Examine every item in the station or just a few. Some items even react to how you interact with them. The more you explore, the more story you reveal, and the more you discover about what's really happening. Or so you may think.  No combat and no true puzzles: There are a few elements you may need to think through but no true puzzles. But there are rewards for those that explore everything. Go as fast or as slow as you like throughout the station. Only the most engaged players will find everything their first play through. If you interact with the world differently in a second play-through you'll see different things.","Free to Play"

Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game offers 5 distinct game-modes with many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The dynamic Frontlines game mode features 64 players taking turns to go over the top and attempt to capture the opposing trench line. Verdun key features include: Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the key theaters on the Western Front Challenging game modes: Team-based Frontlines, tactical Attrition, and skill-based Rifle Deathmatch, desperate survival in Squad Defense and epic 64 player Frontlines including bot support. WW1 on the Western Front The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man’s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn’t for the faint hearted! Authentic World War One Setting The WW1 Game Series currently includes Verdun and Tannenberg (set on the Eastern Front). These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts. Everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1, from the immersive interface and war torn maps to realistic sounds and voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the mud covered trenches, peering out over no man's land in search of the enemy.

A once beautiful, peaceful place is now a tormentor’s paradise; dark, bleak and heavy with fear. You venture along the road to your destination, determined to solve the mystery terrorizing the citizens of Istanbul.  Thousands of bodies line the roads, impaled on bloody poles, ravaged & torn, lying limp; faces contorted in anguish.  If this is just the path to the city, what lies within its walls? A gruesome scene welcomes you; hollow sockets live where eyes once saw their murderer coming for them.  Torsos of young children ripped open, their bodies hung like criminals; blood filled pools in the Cistern house rotting bodies, throats cut, fingers missing.

The Soldier; fierce, strong, and none better with a blade.  Protecting people is your Knightly duty, with your feminine intuition & compassionate heart leading you to do the right thing for the kingdom.  But perhaps you would rather seek to unlock the dark side and become the Assassin.  The choice is yours; will you seek justice or wickedness? Each character unlocks unique levels and secret weapons.  Feel the weight of your decisions and change the story of your game with each turn.  Your actions will determine the future of your people, saving their souls or surrendering them to evil.

This unusual gameplay requires a complete change of your play style. The game is developed just by one person, who is both game designer, artist and programmer in this project. He worked hard for more than 5 years to implement a lot of his and the game community's ideas. GAMEPLAY VIDEO: https://youtu.be/FUkVOGAQdjA BACKGROUND In 2062, the colonial planet “Enigma” was invaded by an aggressive alien race Atroid’s from the parallel world that has gone into our universe through the hypothetical “Gates of Chaos”. This non-material beings were forced to clothe their energy nucleuses in the strong physical shells (exoskeletons), as they needed to have impact on the environment in our world. As a result, they created an army of alien droids which are capable to fight in any environment and at any temperature. The fortifications of the planetary defense line turned out to be not effective against the powerful energy weapon used by the aliens. Soon, the biosphere of the planet felt the destructive power of their deadly attack, and a half of its surface turned into a lifeless desert. The miner colony garrison that was made up of volunteer soldiers suffered huge losses and was urgently evacuated. All resource extraction works on the planet were suspended, and corporations began to bear huge losses. But, after numerous antiwar protests, the government of the Colonial Republic did not want to risk human lives, and scientists had to create an entirely new army of intergalactic operations. The republican fleet and the assault battalion “Delta”, consisting of cyber-guards, heavy machinery and robotic drones-transformers was sent to the planet. The Commanders who have telepathic skills control that steel armada while being aboard the ARKS. For the purpose of their own safety, they are forbidden to leave the ARK. However, they can be directly involved in battles as operators of combat avatars (unmanned combat robotic vehicle). If any combat avatar gets a critical damage, it will be immediately evacuated and, after a quick repair, again will be sent to the battlefield. But, if the aliens are still able to destroy all the ARKS, the Colonial Republic will lose control of the planet forever.. THE AUTHOR'S MESSAGE ""I want to thank the game's community for all the feedback, suggestions and support they have given me during the Early Access period. I came up with idea of this game a long time ago. Once, I'm decided to stop just to dream, but to make it real. Being a professional artist, game designer and programmer, I spent 10 years of my life working for many game companies. Finally I decided to leave my last job, staying home like a hermit for a while, and focusing on my own game title.

Start by generating a procedural world that will be unique to you, design your own custom faction then sail forward fighting pirates, trading with towns, doing quests or simply exploring -- it's up to you how you want to play.  As you sail about you will find resources you can make use of, upgrades for your ship, new towns that will ask your assistance, and as you get farther out from the starting area -- various pirates that will attempt to take what's rightfully yours. Combat experience will let you unlock new talents and abilities to make that particular line of work easier.  As you take up consignments with towns and fulfill their production shortages, the towns will grow, offering more quests, more resources and better items. As the towns continue to grow they will offer you a choice to upgrade your ship itself. Would you prefer a fast Schooner to explore the world, or a heavy Galleon that's able to take up 5 consignments at once? Or perhaps a massive Ship of the Line to take the fight with the pirates to their heartlands?  As you explore the world and get farther away from your starting area, the game will become progressively more difficult -- but so will the rewards. Throughout all of this you can expect the pirates to put up a fair fight, as the AI is bound by the same rules as the player: they have sight, and must explore the map before they can know what's there.  Speaking of AI, build a fearsome reputation and the AI will respect you, even fear you -- avoiding you if at all possible. Some friendly AI will even choose to follow you and assist you in your own adventures.  And so, on the topic of adventures -- ready to have yours?","$9.99"

A detailed strategic layer allows you to co-ordinate the defence of the planet, using your interceptors to shoot down UFOs and researching captured artefacts to learn about your foes and unlock new combat equipment to use on your missions. Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games from the 1990s. We aim to improve the graphics, add new content and streamline the interface whilst still retaining all of the key mechanics of the original games. Devoted fans should love this game, but we're also keen to introduce the joys of old-school grand strategy to a whole new generation of players who might not otherwise experience it! Please note that the native Mac / Linux versions of the game are still in beta, however older WINE-wrapped ""ports"" are available and known to be stable whilst development of the native ports is still ongoing. Key Features Ground Combat: Xenonauts delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic, varied and fully-destructible battlefields, against almost fifty different variants of enemy. Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You'll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time. Deeply asymmetric combat keeps the battles interesting - after all, you're fighting intergalactic invaders with 1970's ballistic technology! Strategic Management: You will also be managing the defence of the planet, dealing with the invading alien UFOs with your customisable interceptors. You need to balance the needs of your funding nations with your own. Your funds are limited - are you going to spend them on battlefield equipment, more scientists, or expanding your coverage of the planet? Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war. Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock, each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them. Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire... Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such, no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area, you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and you'll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base. A lot of time has gone into weaving the two very different halves of the game together into something that feels both natural and enjoyable. ","$24.99"

Demons came in droves and forced the twin Goddesses who ruled the land to whisk their subjects away from the surface, into the safe embrace of the clouds. The demons were persistent, however, erecting a massive tower in pursuit. The battle that raged upon the ground had begun ascending for a second round up above. One day, amidst this turmoil, the Goddesses stole away into the night, vanishing from Ys altogether. And there's only one place they could have gone: the Devil's Tower. A search party of knights and sorcerers was hastily formed and dispatched to the surface in hopes of retrieving these runaway deities. Among its members were apprentice knight Yunica Tovah and troubled sorcerer Hugo Fact. This is their story. Or at least, it's how each of them remembers it. Expanding upon the gameplay elements introduced in Ys: The Ark of Napishtim and further developed in Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Ys Origin perfects the formula by adding different styles of play and new features never before seen in the Ys universe. Best described as an arcade-like platformer RPG with Metroidvania elements and a complex, multi-faceted narrative, Ys Origin is the perfect mix of action, exploration and story. Screen-filling bosses with complex AI, unique platforming elements, innovative puzzles and a deeply involving mystery await within the wildly varied confines of this classic Ys dungeon. Come see how long you can last in the Devil's Tower... Key Features: Officially available in English for the very first time. Three unique playable characters in story mode, with additional variations (and characters?) unlockable through other modes. Five difficulty levels ranging from ""Very Easy"" for casual players to ""Nightmare"" for true Ys masters. Unlockable ""Time Attack"" and ""Boss Rush"" modes for anyone looking to show off his/her boss-taming abilities. Unlockable Arena Mode pits players against massive hordes of enemies for unique gameplay rewards. Over 40 unique Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud support and hundreds of highly competitive leaderboards. Minutely configurable high-resolution graphics with true widescreen support. Fully adjustable controls supporting virtually any USB gamepad, as well as a standard keyboard and mouse setup. ","$19.99"
